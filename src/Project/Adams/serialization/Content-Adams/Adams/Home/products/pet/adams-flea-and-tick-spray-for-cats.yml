      Value: "<strong>Use</strong> <p>It is violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. Important! Read entire label before each use. Use only on cats and kittens 12 weeks of age or older. Shake well before using. DO NOT USE ON OTER ANIMALS. A light, even coverage of the hair coat will provide effective flea control. Do not allow spray from application or damp cat/kitten to come into contact with painted or finished surfaces, including wood floors/furniture, leather/vinyl materials, or other surfaces of concern. 1. For best results, ruffle the coat while spraying against the natural lay of the hair. Cover cat's/kitten's eyes with hand. With a firm, fast stroke, spray head, ears, and chest. If you see a tick, spray it directly. 2. With cloth, rub on face around mouth, nose, and eyes. Then spray the neck, middle and hind quarters, finishing with legs and tail last. Avoid spraying rectum and genitals. 3. For all cats, spray until damp, not saturated. Do not allow cats/kittens to become chilled. 4. If your cat/kitten becomes reinfested with adult fleas or ticks from outside sources, the Adams Flea &amp; Tick Spray for Cats may be reapplied every two weeks after the initial application. Continue treatments for prevention of flea infestation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <strong>Storage</strong> <p>PESTICIDE STORAGE: Do not store near heat or open flame. Keep this product in its tightly closed original container, when not in use. Store in a cool, dry (preferably locked) area that is inaccessible to children and animals.</p>"
