        <p>"My dog sleeps with me and has fleas&mdash;is this a problem?" If you've ever asked yourself this question, the answer is that it very well might turn into an issue. Although fleas tend to prefer dogs, they can hop around and bite you sometimes too. So yes, if your dog has fleas and sleeps in your bed, this could lead to a flea problem that sneaks up on you in your sleep, leaving you with lots of itchy bites in the morning.</p>
        <h2>Signs that Fleas Are in Your Bed</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, if your dog has fleas and sleeps in your bed, your bed will likely end up with fleas. Fleas can lay eggs in your pet's fur, and those eggs can fall off onto your bedding and other areas where your dog sits or sleeps.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=17e48e7d669a4159879b6c289043c492&amp;_z=z">Signs of fleas</a>&nbsp;in your bedding include tiny black specks that are sometimes called "flea dirt." These are flea excrement; if you sprinkle them with a little water, they'll turn a dark-reddish brown.</p>
        <p>Another sign that fleas have invaded your bed are flea bites on your body. Flea bites often look like clusters of small, itchy bites in concentrated areas.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The bites are frequently around your ankles, but they can show up anywhere on your body. If you notice new clusters of bites every time you wake up, this might be a sign there are fleas in your bed. An even more concerning possibility is bed bugs. A bed bug bite can look similar, but these usually appear in a linear row rather than in a cluster.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <h2>Treating Your Home</h2>
        <p>If you believe you have fleas in your bed, you should wash all your bedding in hot water, including your sheets, blankets, pillows, and mattress pad. Also,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe0c9fb83b4c47f9bdef0bd7dde356c1&amp;_z=z">treat your home</a>&nbsp;for fleas, since fleas and their eggs could be in your carpet and other places in your home.&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6ee36e39b37e419b968724f7c8d3a701&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Home Spray</a>&nbsp;kills fleas, ticks, and bed bugs. It starts killing fleas within five minutes of being sprayed and protects against fleas, flea eggs, and flea larvae for up to seven months. It also kills roaches, spiders, ants,* and more.</p>
        <p>Another option is&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=acb7d25555864f339762bd27ffb61b24&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Carpet Powder</a>, which kills fleas in every stage of their life cycle. Each package treats one to two rooms (200 to 400 square feet), and the powder kills fleas for up to 30 days and controls reinfestation for up to 365 days.</p>
        <p>Don't forget to treat your yard too. If you treat everything indoors but let your dog go outside, your pup might carry fleas right back in.&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=71f021b2913f4dd88c8b01de11707fd0&amp;_z=z">Adams Yard &amp; Garden Spray</a>&nbsp;protects from fleas for up to four weeks and also kills ticks, mosquitoes, and ants.</p>
        <h2>Treating Your Dog for Fleas</h2>
        <p>You also want to treat your dog so she doesn't develop a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=638e9339bcb24a18a415777cdad1b208&amp;_z=z">flea infestation</a>. One easy option is the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9fa31da0b8f240d483549e5bb4f68bc8&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Collar Plus for Dogs &amp; Puppies</a>. This collar protects your dog for up to six months. Consider bathing her with the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7b505b9bc1694027809dbe106ca89b27&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Cleansing Shampoo</a>&nbsp;for added protection.</p>
        <p>Treating your pup, your home, and your yard can help ensure that you all stay flea free&mdash;even when you let your dog sleep in your bed. Just make sure you continue treating for fleas,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=57f41d42102a4c6d934627c3035e646e&amp;_z=z">even in the winter</a>.</p>
