        <p>Adult fleas are not picky about their hosts; they can easily jump from one dog to another. Dog parks, boarding kennels, and anywhere else dogs congregate can be a place for fleas to play &ldquo;musical hosts.&rdquo; Dogs can also catch fleas from other animals, such as outdoor/feral cats, or any wildlife passing through your yard or recreation areas.</p>
        <h2>Fleas in the Yard</h2>
        <p>Fleas prefer shaded, moist, undisturbed areas where they can reproduce unhindered &mdash; beneath porches and trees, behind garden sheds, and around kennels and doghouses. Yard debris, brush and even overgrown grass can promote their growth.</p>
        <p>Be sure not to make it easy for these unwanted guests to wind up in your home: Make sure you&rsquo;re taking the necessary steps to get rid of fleas and prevent an infestation.</p>
        <h2>The Prolific Pest</h2>
        <p>Fleas are tiny, measuring just 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch (or 1.5 to 3.3 millimeters). They make themselves at home on a living host as they feed and reproduce. A single female flea can lay up to several hundred eggs over just a few days.</p>
        <p>The slippery eggs fall off your dog&rsquo;s body onto your carpet and furniture, and are capable of lying dormant for weeks before hatching into larvae. They then spin cocoons where they can again remain dormant &mdash; this time for more than six months &mdash; before emerging as adult fleas. If you&rsquo;re not paying attention, you could suddenly find yourself with a full-blown flea infestation.</p>
        <h2>Flea Facts:</h2>

      Value: Adult fleas are not picky about their hosts; they can easily jump from one dog to another. Dog parks, boarding kennels, and anywhere else dogs congregate can be a place for fleas to play “musical hosts.” Dogs can also catch fleas from other animals, such as outdoor/feral cats, or any wildlife passing through your yard or recreation areas.
