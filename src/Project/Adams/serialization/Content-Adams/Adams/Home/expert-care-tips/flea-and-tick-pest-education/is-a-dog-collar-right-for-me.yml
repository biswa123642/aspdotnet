        <p>Summer brings many opportunities for outdoor adventures, but it also brings fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. Maybe you and your pet are spending more time outside together, or you're hiking and walking more frequently. If you're looking for an easy way to protect your pet, you may be wondering, "Do flea collars work on dogs and cats?" The answer is yes. When used according to label directions, flea collars can protect your pet from itchy, annoying flea bites.</p>
        <h2>Flea Collars Work Well on Cats</h2>
        <p>When looking for a flea product for your cat, make sure you get one designed especially for cats. Flea collars typically work best if they have an insect growth regulator (IGR) that kills the flea eggs and flea larvae.</p>
        <p>Test your collar to see how well your cat tolerates it.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Look for ones that don't have a strong smell and watch for any skin reactions. Make sure you use one with a collar that has a safety feature to break loose and not get caught on something while your cat is climbing or playing.</p>
        <p>If your cat doesn't seem to take to a flea collar, you can try other options like a&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=d85a03ea3a70400a9459d62ea0c42deb&amp;_z=z">spot-on treatment</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=81de828938e04366a42f95e83207a7cd&amp;_z=z">cleansing shampoo</a>&nbsp;designed for cats. If you have any concerns, ask your veterinarian.</p>
        <h2>Flea Collars Work Great on Dogs Too</h2>
        <p>Your dog can certainly benefit from flea collars if that's your preference. Flea collars are typically effective for months, giving lasting protection to dogs.</p>
        <p>Just like cats, watch your dog for localized skin reactions or allergies.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;If you have an especially large dog, the collar might have some trouble protecting your dog's entire body. If your dog doesn't take to a flea collar, there are other products you can try, including a&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=a059a97e97bb448fb7d25229dcefde2b&amp;_z=z">spot-on treatment</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=99943031d6b4425392b14bb8d285e33c&amp;_z=z">flea and tick foaming shampoo</a>. If you have any questions, talk to your veterinarian.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of Flea Collars for Dogs and Cats</h2>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>If you're always on the go, flea and tick collars offer several advantages to fit your lifestyle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost-effective.&nbsp;Collars typically provide up to six months of protection at an inexpensive price point.</li>
            <li>No reminders necessary.&nbsp;If your busy schedule causes you to forget the last date you applied drops and sprays, collars are a great substitute. Once the collar is on, your pet is protected.</li>
            <li>Easy to Use.&nbsp;Topicals require some application and drying time. Flea and tick collars attach in seconds. The active ingredient released from the collar contacts the skin and hair and spreads outward over their body with time and movement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ff1c383797b841b1914578717fb8630f&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Collar for Dogs &amp; Puppies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=b3b96ea41cc14edba30905744517f600&amp;_z=z">Adams Plus Flea &amp; Tick Collar for Cats</a>&nbsp;offer benefits like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Around the clock protection.&nbsp;Collars provide 24/7 protection ensuring your pet is pest-free, anywhere at any time.</li>
            <li>Repels mosquitoes.*&nbsp;The Adams collar for dogs also repels mosquitoes,* which brings added protection. No more worrying during hot, humid walks or hikes.</li>
            <li>Water-resistant.&nbsp;Your pup can doggie paddle with confidence.</li>
            <li>One size fits all.&nbsp;Just measure, attach, and snip off any excess.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, as with all flea collars or any flea control product, to follow the directions carefully, whether using the product for a cat or a dog.</p>
        <h2>Flea Collars Work Best as Part of an Overall Prevention Program</h2>
        <p>Flea collars work best when they're part of a larger flea prevention program, where you also use flea products for your home and yard.&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1c1625c5e0534a21b4704655aa39086c&amp;_z=z">Adams Plus Flea &amp; Tick Indoor Fogger</a>&nbsp;kills many insects, including fleas, mosquitoes, silverfish, cockroaches, ants, spiders, and ticks. For the outdoors, try&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=71f021b2913f4dd88c8b01de11707fd0&amp;_z=z">Adams Yard &amp; Garden Spray</a>. It kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, and ants.</p>
        <p>When looking for a flea collar or any other type of flea treatment for your pet, make sure you find one designed specifically for cats or dogs and appropriate for your pet's age. If you have any questions, talk to your veterinarian.</p>
