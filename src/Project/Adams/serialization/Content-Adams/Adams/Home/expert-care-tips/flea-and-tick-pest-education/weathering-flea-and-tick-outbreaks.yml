        <p><em>Snapshot: Where fleas and ticks are most prevalent</em></p>
        <p>Are you tired of flea and tick season yet? You&rsquo;re not alone! Flea and tick outbreaks&mdash;triggered by factors including temperature and humidity levels&mdash;affect most parts of the United States at various points throughout the year. Recognizing when your pet is most at risk is important &ndash; such as knowing the symptoms of Lyme disease in dogs and cats --because knowledge is power&mdash;and the more you know, the more prepared you and your furry friend will be.</p>
        <h2>Where Fleas and Ticks Roam</h2>
        <p>In the yard, fleas like warm, moist places&mdash;not hot and dry and not cold and frosty. If you live in an area with deep frost, those fleas living outdoors may go dormant for the winter, but not those that have made their way indoors. In more temperate climates, fleas are active outdoors all year. In fact, southern portions of the U.S. have the biggest flea problems, but summertime in most areas can bring a plague of fleas to ruin your fun in the sun. Outdoor activities for dogs can carry risks, so be aware.</p>
        <p>Ticks thrive in regions with warmer, more humid temperatures as well, but they are also found in the woods, shrubs, brush, and undergrowth of most areas of the country, regardless of the climate. So no matter where you live, if your pet likes to go on hikes with you or roam in fields and on farms, the risk of a tick infestation increases.</p>
        <p>Fleas and ticks become more widespread when humidity levels are between 50 and 90 percent and when the temperature is 70&deg;F or greater.</p>
