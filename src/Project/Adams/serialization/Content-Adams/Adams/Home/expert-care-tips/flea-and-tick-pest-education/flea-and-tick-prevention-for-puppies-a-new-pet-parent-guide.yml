        <p>Congratulations on your decision to adopt a new furry bundle of joy! As a soon-to-be pet parent, you're gearing up for what to expect in those first few months. You're researching how to train your dog. You're talking with friends so you can <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=dde300c6765942c08bdea0267a12732d&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose a veterinarian</a> for your puppy. And you're stocking up on puppy-safe toys, comfy bedding, and fun food and water bowls. But when preparing for your new four-legged arrival, don't overlook flea and tick prevention for puppies.</p>
        <h2>What to Ask About Flea and Tick Prevention</h2>
        <p>The best way to protect your puppy is to prevent him from getting fleas and ticks in the first place. It's true that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Rather than trying to stop a flea infestation, it's much easier to take a preventive approach. Plus, by protecting your puppy from fleas and ticks, you're keeping him healthy. These pests can cause health problems such as skin infections, fur loss, anemia, and tapeworms.</p>
        <p>Here are three essential questions to ask about flea and tick protection before adopting your puppy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why does a new puppy need flea and tick prevention products?</li>
            <li>How old does a puppy have to be before starting flea and tick prevention treatments?</li>
            <li>Does a puppy need flea and tick prevention products specifically formulated for puppies? Or are products designed for all dogs safe?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to the Plymouth Veterinary Hospital, most <a href="https://www.plymouthvet.com/services/dogs/puppy-flea-and-tick-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flea and tick products</a> are not safe to use until puppies are at least seven or eight weeks old.<sup>1</sup> For younger pups, consider finding and removing fleas weekly with a flea comb. When your puppy is a little older, his vet can recommend specific products for safe flea and tick prevention.</p>
        <p>Also, the American Veterinary Medical Association suggests these questions about <a href="https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/safe-use-flea-and-tick-preventive-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flea and tick prevention for puppies</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which parasites does this product protect against?</li>
            <li>How often should this product be used?</li>
            <li>How long does it take for the product to start working?</li>
            <li>What if the puppy reacts poorly to the product?</li>
            <li>Does a puppy need more than one flea protection product?</li>
            <li>How are multiple flea and tick protection products applied?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How to Prepare Your Home and Yard</h2>
        <p>Now that you know about safe flea and tick prevention for puppies, you'll want to prepare for your puppy's arrival. This includes proactively treating inside your home and outside in your yard.</p>
        <p>In your home:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a new pet bed or thoroughly wash a used bed with hot water and laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>Use new toys or wash gently loved toys with hot water and soap.</li>
            <li>Vacuum your home with a high-quality vacuum cleaner with an agitator. Include carpets, floors, and upholstery.</li>
            <li>Try an indoor room fogger for large areas of carpeted floors and other upholstered surfaces. Try a carpet spray for a more targeted approach. For a broader coverage of household surfaces, consider a combination of these products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In your yard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut the grass. Collect and discard the clippings, which may contain ticks, fleas, and flea eggs.</li>
            <li>Spray any outdoor areas where your pet may play with a yard spray for broad coverage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These precautions can help protect your furry family members and your property from fleas and ticks. By being proactive, you can eliminate pests, their eggs, and their larvae no matter where they lurk.</p>
        <h2>What Prevention and Protection Supplies to Keep on Hand</h2>
        <p>Finally, to ensure your puppy stays free of fleas and ticks, stock your cabinets with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=a059a97e97bb448fb7d25229dcefde2b&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevention</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=79ddf28d04bb4879ac41753a012eec83&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protection supplies</a>. You'll need to treat your pet, home, and yard for fleas year-round to kill adult fleas, eggs, and larvae. Some suggestions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-quality puppy food to ensure your pet stays healthy, including his skin and coat.</li>
            <li>A flea and tick collar that kills adult fleas and ticks and repels mosquitoes for up to six months.</li>
            <li>A fine-toothed flea comb for regular grooming and flea detection.</li>
            <li>Flea and tick shampoo for puppies.</li>
            <li>Flea and tick treatments, such as a topical that lasts 30 days.</li>
            <li>Flea and tick prevention products for your home, such as a carpet and home spray.</li>
            <li>Flea and tick prevention products for your yard.</li>
