        <p>When winter fades, and spring finally rolls in, it's only natural to want to head outdoors and soak up some much-needed sunshine with your furry friends. But you and your pets aren't the only creatures ready to frolic in the nicer weather. This season marks a jump in tick and flea activity. Be wise when it comes to these pests, and note that spring is the time to step up flea and tick protection for dogs and cats.</p>
        <h2>The Springtime Surge of Ticks and Fleas</h2>
        <p>Fleas and ticks are resilient. Even the frosty winter months can't keep them down for too long. Ticks and fleas can stay active year-round in much of the U.S. As the American Kennel Club notes, flea and tick season picks up with spring and varies by <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/whats-your-states-flea-and-tick-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geographical region</a>.<sup>1</sup> Some ticks, such as American dog ticks, are most abundant during these months.</p>
        <p>This season brings warmth, moisture, and humidity to your lawn, and these pests respond. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, immature ticks known as nymphs are responsible for most <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tick bites</a> that transmit disease to people and pets.<sup>2 </sup>Nymphs are extremely small, so they're easy to miss. These tiny ticks are most active once temperatures rise above 37 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Birds, rabbits, and rodents leave their winter shelter early in this season. And your outdoor dog or cat may be more likely to run into wildlife at this time. After a long winter, ticks and fleas are focused on blood meals and reproduction. Wild animals &mdash; even robins &mdash; can carry ticks and fleas and pass them on to dogs and cats through direct and indirect contact. This season also means increased traffic in and out of your home as activities pick up. Fleas and ticks can hitch a ride on people and pets going in and out of the house.</p>
        <h2>How to Protect Against Ticks and Fleas</h2>
        <p>After the winter frost thaws, the increased flea and tick activity means you need to be extra diligent about protecting your home and yard against an invasion. Lawn grasses may get a little shaggy before you mow, providing the perfect spot for ticks to wait. Soggy leaves around homes or under shrubs create ideal hiding places for adult ticks. As entomologist Kirby C. Stafford notes, eventually, <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CAES/DOCUMENTS/Publications/Bulletins/b1010pdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ticks</a> will lay thousands of eggs to hatch in your yard.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>Spring is a perfect time to get proactive and safeguard your pets, home, and yard from ticks and fleas. You can fight off fleas and ticks with a three-pronged approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protect your pets.</strong> Enjoy some extra grooming time and check your dog or cat regularly. On pets, ticks tend to hide near ears, eyes, tails, toes, and between legs. Learn <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=35128266ace342e395f97c3dcb190acb&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to remove ticks from dogs</a> and cats safely. Talk with your vet about vaccines for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=90378786090149d383a5a6f19829dcea&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tick-borne Lyme disease</a> and other concerns. Use <a href="https://www.adamspetcare.com/products/pet#facets=Product%20Type:Collar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams<sup>TM</sup> Flea &amp; Tick Collars</a> for dogs and cats to help kill fleas and ticks on your pet, and repel others from latching on.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #333f48;">Protect your home.</strong> When checking for ticks and fleas, don't overlook other family members. Most tick bites happen in back and front yards, so check everyone when they come inside. Don't wait to treat indoor areas where dogs and cats hang out after outdoor play. If any pests do make it inside, use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1c1625c5e0534a21b4704655aa39086c&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams<sup>TM</sup> Plus Flea &amp; Tick Indoor Fogger</a> to kill fleas, eggs, and larvae. </li>
            <li><strong style="color: #333f48;">Protect your yard. </strong>Turn your yard into a safe haven and prevent problems before they start. Clean up leaves or other winter debris and mow your lawn early to eliminate flea and tick hideouts. Apply <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=71f021b2913f4dd88c8b01de11707fd0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams<sup>TM</sup> Yard &amp; Garden Spray</a> for 5,000 square feet of coverage and protection.</li>
