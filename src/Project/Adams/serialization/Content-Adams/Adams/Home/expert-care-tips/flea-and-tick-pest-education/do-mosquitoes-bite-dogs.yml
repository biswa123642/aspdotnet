        <p>Do mosquitoes bite dogs? Unfortunately, the answer is yes, they do. And if you don't prevent mosquito bites, then your dog is at risk of developing heartworm disease. That's why it's important to invest in mosquito repellent for dogs.</p>
        <h2>Mosquitoes Don't Just Bite Dogs</h2>
        <p>You're not the only one that mosquitoes might view as a tasty treat during the summer months. Mosquitoes are very likely to bite your dog too.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;They're usually drawn to a wider surface on your dog, like the back or the back legs, but they can bite your pup anywhere. Dogs typically itch at mosquito bites for a few hours at the most.</p>
        <p>But itching isn't the worst thing about mosquitoes. Dogs can sometimes&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=73915ea2bc694515a2e68ccd8877204e&amp;_z=z">get heartworms</a>&nbsp;from mosquito bites. An infected mosquito bite can carry immature worms called microfilaria into your dog's bloodstream. They settle into your dog's heart after a couple of months and start growing. If a mosquito bites an infected dog, it can pass heartworms along to other dogs, continuing the cycle.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes can cause other infections too, like West Nile virus or Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). Both are rare in dogs, but not impossible to catch.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Dogs might also be able to get the Zika virus from mosquitoes, but it's not entirely clear since cases are so rare.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;All these viruses can be serious if infected mosquitoes bite humans, which is yet another reason to protect your home against the small buzzing predators.</p>
        <h2>Try Some Mosquito Repellent for Dogs</h2>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8f160006abf74870b30a44468b11ed43&amp;_z=z">Protecting your dog from mosquitoes</a>&nbsp;is crucial to keep your pup heartworm-free. This is made easy by mosquito repellent products that are designed specifically for dogs. You can also invest in flea and tick repellents that come with the added bonus of driving away mosquitoes.</p>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ff1c383797b841b1914578717fb8630f&amp;_z=z">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Collar for Dogs and Puppies</a>&nbsp;repels mosquitoes* for up to six months per collar. Each package comes with two collars, providing a full year of coverage. The one-size-fits-all collars are adjustable and water-resistant. Designed with extended-release technology, these collars are great for defending against adult fleas and ticks too.</p>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=a059a97e97bb448fb7d25229dcefde2b&amp;_z=z">Adams Plus Flea &amp; Tick Spot On for Dogs</a>&nbsp;is a topical treatment you can put on your dog that both repels and kills mosquitoes. The product also kills adult fleas and ticks and prevents flea reinfestation for up to 30 days per treatment.</p>
        <p>In addition to protecting your dog, you may want to protect your yard too. Get rid of any standing water where mosquitoes can breed, and don't take your dog out at dusk or dawn when mosquitoes are most active. If you want to take your "mosquito security" to another level, you can further protect against the annoying insects using&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=71f021b2913f4dd88c8b01de11707fd0&amp;_z=z">Adams Yard &amp; Garden Spray</a>. This spray kills not only mosquitoes, but fleas, ticks, and ants as well.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, mosquitoes are just as interested in your dog as they are in you. That's why a good mosquito repellent is important, along with treating your yard. With a little preparation, you and your pup can enjoy as many outdoor adventures as you want without fear of buzzing insects ruining your fun.</p>
