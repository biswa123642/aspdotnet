        <p>The holidays are fast approaching, and you&rsquo;re likely thinking about your resolutions for the new year. But what about your furry friend? Here are 7 manageable resolutions that you can make to keep you and your dog happy and healthy throughout the year.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #1:</h2>
        <p>Maintain your dog at a healthy weight. If he&rsquo;s overweight, talk to the vet about a sensible weight-loss plan.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #2:</h2>
        <p>Take your dog to the vet for an annual physical exam. Just one appointment a year with your vet can save your best friend&rsquo;s life.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #3:</h2>
        <p>Take care of yourself! Your pup needs you to be healthy and long-lived, just like you want him to be. So go get your own annual checkups, and ask your doctor about a diet and exercise plan for yourself if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #4:</h2>
        <p>Get some kind of exercise daily. This is pretty easy to do with a dog, since it might mean just chasing his favorite toy around the house for 20 minutes at a time. For most dogs, an additional daily walk or two is ideal.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #5:</h2>
        <p>Treat your dog to playtime with other dogs. Most love to play or lounge together. Find a play group (or start one) of other nicely behaved dogs. Your dog will love you for it.</p>
        <h2>Resolution #6:</h2>
        <p>Unwind with your dog. As your stress piles up throughout the year, imagine what you seem like to your dog. Your dog picks up on your stress, which makes him more prone to excessive barking, turning a deaf ear to commands, or engaging in destructive chewing behaviors. Take some time every day to just relax together&mdash;you&rsquo;ll notice a difference in both of your stress levels!</p>
        <h2>Resolution #7:</h2>
        <p>Renew your bond with your dog. Take time every day to show him how much you appreciate him. Whether it&rsquo;s a daily walk, playtime, or snuggle time&mdash;or all three!&mdash;your dog will love spending those precious minutes with you.</p>
