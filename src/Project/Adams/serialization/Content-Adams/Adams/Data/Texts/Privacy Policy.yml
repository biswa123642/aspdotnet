        <p>1. What information does ADAMSPETCARE.COM collect from you?</p>
        <p>In order to better provide you with numerous products, ADAMSPETCARE.COM collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
        <p>Personally Identifiable Information<br />
        This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, and product details. With this information, ADAMSPETCARE.COM can better provide you with personalized services. For a few services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of other merchants and share it with them. If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you have questions about their information practices, please read their privacy policies.</p>
        <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br />
        This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
        <p>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</p>
        <p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide ADAMSPETCARE.COM's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and to administer our systems.</p>
        <p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or Web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with a report of the pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the ADAMSPETCARE.COM visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. ADAMSPETCARE.COM also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during a promotion, from our server log files, from our Web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p>
        <p>We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and Web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "third parties"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our third parties not to disclose or use your Personally Identifiable Information for purposes other than to provide services to you or ADAMSPETCARE.COM.</p>
        <p>We gather information in the following ways:</p>
        <p>Online Surveys and Polling<br />
        In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.</p>
        <p>Contests and Sweepstakes<br />
        When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to Farnam's policies. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility on a Release, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules.</p>
        <p>Promotional E-mails<br />
        We offer promotional e-mails as a service to our customers. We will send you e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals. To stop receiving these e-mails, please send an e-mail to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contactus@adamspetcare.com">contactus@adamspetcare.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Contact Information and Third Party Data<br />
        If you contact ADAMSPETCARE.COM or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, e-mail address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on our site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you.</p>
        <p>We also track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online sessions, including which pages, information and advertisements a customer views while using the site. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information.</p>
        <p>We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information with third parties.</p>
        <p>Cookies<br />
        We use cookies and may allow others to use cookies in the operation of our site.</p>
        <p>Action Tags/Web Beacons<br />
        We may use and allow others to use action tags or web beacons in the operation of our site.</p>
        <p>3. Who is collecting your information?</p>
        <p>Email Services: We use a third party to send promotional e-mails to customers. Images contained in the email may be served by the third party. They collect certain information about you such as your IP address, browser type, your operating system, the country and server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located, the time and date that a particular email was viewed, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad or email, products viewed. They may use a "cookie" or "action tags."</p>
        <p>Web site Analysis Agent: We may contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and marketing. We use the services of marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use action tags and cookies provided by the marketing companies on this site. The type of information we collect includes things such as pages, information and advertisements viewed. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the marketing companies log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by contacting us at ADAMSPETCARE.COM. For more information, please see the section "Use of Cookies and Action Tags" below.</p>
        <p>4. With whom do we share your information?</p>
        <p>Other Parties: We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent. We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ADAMSPETCARE.COM, our users, or others.</p>
        <p>Services Provided on Our Site: Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, without your consent, ADAMSPETCARE.COM does not disclose its customers' Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants.</p>
        <p>Data Analysis Agents: The information collected by or for ADAMSPETCARE.COM may be provided to an outside company for the purpose of analysis. That analysis is to help us to improve our site and product selection, and to notify you of special offers that may be of interest to you. That data analysis agent may not share any Personally Identifiable Information with others, or use it for any other purpose than to help ADAMSPETCARE.COM.</p>
        <p>Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement: Occasionally ADAMSPETCARE.COM may be asked by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, without prior notice to you. ADAMSPETCARE.COM fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies as requested or required. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities.</p>
        <p>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information</p>
        <p>E-mail: We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials and new additions to the ADAMSPETCARE.COM site. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contactus@adamspetcare.com">contactus@adamspetcare.com</a>. After doing so, ADAMSPETCARE.COM users will not receive future promotional e-mails unless they open a new account, enter a contest, or sign up to receive newsletters or e-mails.</p>
        <p>Ad-servers and other Content Servers: You may also set your browser so that it will not accept "cookies" to prevent assignment from the ad server of a unique identifier; however, you will still be able to shop on our site if you do so.</p>
        <p>6. A special note about children's privacy</p>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under 18 years of age and believe that they have disclosed Personally Identifiable Information to us, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contactus@adamspetcare.com">contactus@adamspetcare.com</a>&nbsp;so that we may delete the minor's information.</p>
        <p>7. ADAMSPETCARE.COM and third-party use of "Cookies" and "Action Tags."</p>
        <p>ADAMSPETCARE.COM Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to ADAMSPETCARE.COM. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, allow you to retrieve an earlier shopping cart, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. You will still be able to shop on our site if your browser is set not to accept cookies.</p>
        <p>Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements and other information on our site or to serve promotional e-mails. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional e-mails, ADAMSPETCARE.COM does not provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. ADAMSPETCARE.COM and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed on a specific Web site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier.</p>
        <p>Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze what our visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to track the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        <p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a Web site page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers and Web site analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed. Without collecting any Personally Identifiable Information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites.</p>
        <p>E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide ADAMSPETCARE.COM with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with them Web site usage information about visitors to our Web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of action tags.</p>
        <p>8. You should carefully review privacy policies of any third party sites accessible from ADAMSPETCARE.COM</p>
        <p>Other sites accessible through our Web site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. ADAMSPETCARE.COM is not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that this site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those Web sites linked to ADAMSPETCARE.COM are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
        <p>On behalf of various sponsors, ADAMSPETCARE.COM provides sponsored links to third-party Web sites. If you click on a sponsored link or banner ad, a "window" or "frame" containing a third-party's Web site may appear in the foreground with the ADAMSPETCARE.COM Web site in the background. Unless you are on ADAMSPETCARE.COM's web site, any time that you have moved to a window, you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the windowed site's privacy policy (if any).</p>
