        <h2>About the Central Leadership Council Summit - Leading the Future Together</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>CLC,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nearly two years ago, we assembled the Central Leadership Council (CLC), a diverse and powerful group of leaders, to act as a united leadership body to improve the way we collectively activate our strategies and values in ways that inspire Central employees. Since that time, you all have played a vital role in advancing our&nbsp;<em>Central to Home</em>&nbsp;strategy and leading important company priorities and projects that have benefited the broader organization. I want to thank you for the work and time you have dedicated to these efforts and beyond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We are very pleased to finally (and safely) bring this group together in person for our first-ever CLC Summit. The theme for our meeting is "Leading the Future Together." We know that in order to take our company into its next chapter of growth and achieve our mission to lead the future of the garden and pet industries, we need to act as an inspiring and united front.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At our summit, we will strengthen and further our knowledge of the great businesses that make up Central Garden &amp; Pet, realize opportunities to further our strategy and leave with new relationships that will help us lead our company into the future.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thanks in advance for making time to participate in this exciting event. I look forward to seeing you in person in Arizona this June!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><img alt="Tim" src="-/media/1082E2798BA6481AB67057657F42873A.ashx" /></p>
