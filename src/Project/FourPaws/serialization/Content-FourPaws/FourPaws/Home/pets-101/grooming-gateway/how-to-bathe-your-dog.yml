        <br /><p><br /> Bathing your dog may seem like a monumental chore, but with the right supplies you can have a clean fur buddy in no time.<br /> <br /> 1. The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do, even before you attempt to bathe your dog, is to teach him the stand command. This will ensure that he stands still and doesn&rsquo;t slip and injure himself or you in the tub. Ask your trainer or grab a book with how-to instructions for stand.<br /> <br /> 2. Now that you are ready to get going, gather all of your supplies together. You&rsquo;ll need:<br /> <ul>     <li>Dog shampoo and conditioner, like <strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C30D7AE1D849418CA0B24577982C5BCD&amp;_z=z">Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Hypo-Allergenic Shampoo and Conditioner</a></strong>, which are soothing and great for all coat types</li>     <li>Shower spray attachment</li>     <li>Cotton balls</li>     <li>Towel</li> </ul> <br /> 3. You may be able to wash a toy dog in the sink; most other dogs will be heading to the bathtub. Place a no-slip mat on the bottom so that your dog has something to stand on.<br /> <br /> 4. Put cotton balls in his ears to avoid getting water inside.<br /> <br /> 5. Before getting your dog wet, brush out any tangles or mats in his coat. If a knot gets wet it just gets tighter and harder to get out.<br /> <br /> 6. Thoroughly wet him with the spray attachment, using warm (not hot) water.<br /> <br /> 7. Once he&rsquo;s wet, rub the shampoo into the coat. Make sure to get the belly and legs, and avoid your dog&rsquo;s eyes.<br /> <br /> 8. Rinse out the shampoo using the spray attachment. Rinse again. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Leftover shampoo in the coat can make your dog dry and itchy.<br /> <br /> 9. Add conditioner if you&rsquo;d like; longer-coated breeds can benefit from conditioner, and so can dogs with dry coats.<br /> <br /> 10. Quickly towel-dry your dog and soak up most of the excess water.<br /> <br /> 11. In warmer months, a short- or medium-coated dog can air-dry. But if it&rsquo;s very cold or your dog has a more complicated coat, it&rsquo;s time to blow-dry. Invest in a blow-dryer made just for dogs, as they will not overheat the skin. Blow-dry sections of the coat at a time.<br /> <br /> 12. If you&rsquo;d like, finish with a little coat conditioning spray.<br /> <br /> There you have it&mdash;a fresh, clean dog who is ready to go outside and roll around in the mud (again!)<br /></p>
