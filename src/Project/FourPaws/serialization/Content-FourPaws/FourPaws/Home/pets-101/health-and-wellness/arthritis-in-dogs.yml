        <br /><p>Arthritis is a problem that many dogs face, especially as they age. Osteoarthritis, sometimes known as Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD), is a chronic form of arthritis marked by inflammation and/or excessive bone formation around a dog's joints, making movement uncomfortable and more difficult.</p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pagepress.org/journals/index.php/vsd/article/view/5931/6327" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis affects approximately one in four of the more than 77 million dogs</a> in the United States, leading to cartilage degeneration and stiff joints. While osteoarthritis in dogs can technically develop at any age, the inflammatory disease is most commonly diagnosed later in a dog&rsquo;s life cycle. This is when it can especially begin to affect movement, comfort, and overall quality of life.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are ways for dog parents to detect and manage arthritis to keep their dogs of all ages happy, mobile, and comfortable with a few simple, proactive steps.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Causes of Arthritis in Dogs </h2><br /><p>A wide variety of factors have been linked to arthritis formation in dogs. While research isn&rsquo;t conclusive on the exact causes, many scientists believe that the degenerative disease has roots in a dog&rsquo;s body type and history.</p> <p>While there is no single cause, the below conditions are believed to contribute:</p> <ul>     <li><strong>Body shape,</strong> especially in large dogs, can place unhealthy amounts of pressure on one or more of your dog&rsquo;s joints.</li>     <li><strong>Joint development issues</strong> can lead to the incomplete or incorrect growth of your dog&rsquo;s joints. Developmental issues can increase your dog&rsquo;s likelihood of arthritis as they age.</li>     <li><strong>Obesity</strong> often leads to canine arthritis, since extra weight yields negative consequences for your dog&rsquo;s joints over time.</li>     <li><strong>Past injury history</strong> can also play a role in canine arthritis development. If your dog injured a joint in the past, it might become more susceptible to joint issues.</li>     <li><strong>Exercise</strong> can help keep your dog&rsquo;s joints flexible over time. Conversely, a lack of exercise can contribute to joint stiffness, one of the main symptoms of canine arthritis.</li>     <li><strong>Genetic disposition</strong> may also influence your dog&rsquo;s likelihood to develop arthritis. If your dog&rsquo;s immediate family members were affected by arthritis, their likelihood to suffer from arthritis may increase.</li> </ul> <p>Some dogs are at a greater risk for developing arthritis later in life, depending on a few risk factors. Namely, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198754/" target="_blank">age, breed, and weight can dictate their overall risk for arthritis</a>, though simply &ldquo;getting older&rdquo; is not in itself a cause of canine osteoarthritis.</p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/caring-for-elderly-and-disabled-pets" target="_blank">Caring for your aging pet</a> is even more important as they grow older, especially if they develop some form of arthritis. To help your aging animal prolong a happy life, consider optimizing their diet, activity, and mental exercise to protect against unwanted cartilage formation.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Signs & Symptoms of Arthritis in Dogs </h2><br /><p>If your dog is experiencing arthritis, you&rsquo;ll likely be able to identify several associated symptoms. Dogs that encounter mobility issues, tender joints, and lethargy may be experiencing some form of arthritis, particularly if these signs become more prevalent with age.</p> <p>Look for some of the following signs and symptoms:</p> <ul>     <li>Decreases in daily exercise or willingness to play</li>     <li>Difficulty standing, sitting, or lying down</li>     <li>Reluctance to climb or descend stairs</li>     <li>Sustained periods of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/why-do-dogs-lick-their-paws" target="_blank">paw licking</a></li>     <li>Trembling or visible limping</li>     <li>Refusal to place weight on one or more limbs</li> </ul> <p>These common signs and symptoms could indicate that your dog is experiencing some form of arthritis.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Diagnosing Arthritis in Dogs </h2><br /><p>If your dog has difficulty moving, exhibits a reduction in exercise, or is reluctant to play, arthritis might be the cause. Symptoms that continue or worsen over time could further indicate the presence of arthritis in your dog&rsquo;s joints.</p> <p>Ultimately, canine arthritis isn&rsquo;t a diagnosis you can make on your own. If you suspect that your dog might be experiencing it, consult the help of a professional veterinarian. Medical professionals can help assess your dog&rsquo;s needs in light of their symptoms, and will help you determine the optimal path forward.</p> <p>If your dog is diagnosed with arthritis, you can begin working to help them manage their discomfort and overcome symptoms as they develop. Your veterinarian will begin work on a treatment plan personalized to your dog to help them live their best life post-diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Managing Arthritis in Dogs </h2><br /><p>Canine arthritis has no known cure. However, by effectively managing your dog&rsquo;s symptoms you can help them maintain a high quality of life. Medication, treatment, and even therapy can help your dog continue to live happily despite an arthritis diagnosis.</p> <p>Management options can include:</p> <ul>     <li><strong>Pain medications,</strong> typically non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to help slow tissue damage and control discomfort</li>     <li><strong>Diet changes</strong> to ensure your dog maintains a healthy weight and receives sufficient nutrition</li>     <li><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/joint-supplements-for-dogs" target="_blank">Canine supplements</a></strong> that help minimize stress-points, especially on the hips and joints</li>     <li><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/top-vitamins-for-dogs" target="_blank">Canine vitamins</a></strong> that help fortify bones and improve immune functionality&nbsp;</li>     <li><strong>Activity plans</strong> that promote healthy movement without further injuring arthritic joints, even if you need to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/exercising-dog-indoors" target="_blank">exercise your dog indoors</a></li> </ul> <p>Depending on the severity of your dog&rsquo;s arthritis, a variety of resources can help connect you with the help your furry friend needs. For mild joint discomfort, supplements or diet changes are often effective. Veterinary clinics and canine specialists can also provide the therapy and medical support your dog needs as symptoms mature.</p> <p>From simple physical activity to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/products/healthy-promise-advanced-formula-hip-and-joint-supplements-for-dogs" target="_blank">advanced formula hip and joint supplements</a>, these and other treatment options help to delay arthritis symptoms, promote health, and prepare your pet for the years to come.</p> <p>Regular movement and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/family-matters/dog-playtime" target="_blank">safe playtime</a> will become even more important as your dog ages, especially to avoid obesity and sustain blood circulation. Even if your dog can no longer sprint, they can still enjoy several forms of physical activity. Consider <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/potty-time-and-training/how-to-walk-a-dog-safely" target="_blank">taking your dog for a leashed walk</a> or a swim if they enjoy the water.</p> <p>As always, make sure to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/dog-safety-in-the-great-outdoors" target="_blank">maintain outdoor safety with your dog</a> if you venture outside of your own home while exercising.&nbsp;</p>
