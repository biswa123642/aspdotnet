        <br /><p><br />Brushing your dog regularly not only keeps his coat looking good, it helps release dead hair, cuts down on excess shedding, removes mats, and distributes the natural oils in the skin to keep your dog healthy.<br /><br />To make brushing safe and comfortable, teach your dog the stand command. This tells him that he needs to stand in one place until you say otherwise. Ask your trainer or grab a book with how-to instructions for stand.<br /><br />Now it&rsquo;s time to gather your supplies so that you won&rsquo;t have to go looking for them in the middle of the grooming process. Depending on your dog&rsquo;s coat, you will need the following:<br /><ul>    <li>bristle brush</li>    <li>comb</li>    <li>curry brush</li>    <li>mat and tangle remover</li>    <li>pin brush</li>    <li>scissors</li>    <li>shedding blade</li>    <br /></ul>Find a comfortable place to brush your dog. You&rsquo;ll be loosening up dead hair and the fur may start flying, so brushing him on the Oriental rug or white chenille couch might not be the best choice.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Short to Medium Coats</h2><br /><p>For short to medium coats, use a bristle brush like the <strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F50BD052F3784D5CBAA505A99D308B32&amp;_z=z">Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Dual-Sided Combo Brush</a></strong>. This is a great all-around tool because it has a bristle brush on one side and a pin brush on the other. Brush in the direction of hair growth. Don&rsquo;t use too much pressure so that it hurts your dog&rsquo;s skin; instead, apply firm strokes that will help remove dead hairs.<br /><br /> Then use a shedding blade to grab dead hairs all over the coat. Shedding blades are an excellent way to help reduce shedding and prevent mats.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Long Coats</h2><br /><p>For a long-coated breed, you are going to have to take a bit more time. Part the hair in sections and run a pin brush or <strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6F93B2742E9644119BA4642BFDB77449&amp;_z=z">Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Pet Comb</a></strong> through each section. If you find mats, use the <strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D3EF98E2072746D9913B2F8665376B53&amp;_z=z">Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Instant Mat &amp; Tangle Remover</a></strong> to eliminate them.<br /> <br /> Use scissors and a comb to carefully trim long hairs around your dog&rsquo;s face and eyes.<br /> <br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Wire Coats</h2><br /><p>If you have a wire-coated dog, you will have to learn how to pluck the dead hairs out of the coat using either your hands or a stripping knife. This type of grooming may be best left to the professionals. If you are determined to learn, ask your groomer or breeder to show you the proper technique.<br /></p>
