        <br /><p><br />Look into the eyes of your darling dog and you&rsquo;ll see unbridled love and devotion reflected back at you. Those expressive eyes say so much, and it&rsquo;s up to you to keep them healthy and looking good. You may not think about caring for your dog&rsquo;s eyes as a part of his regular grooming routine, but it is important to include an eye check as part of the process.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Perform a Visual Check</h2><br /><p>The first thing you need to do is to visually inspect your dog&rsquo;s eyes. Look for redness, swelling, or unusual discharge. The eyes should be clear and bright, and the lining should appear pink and healthy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dogs who exercise in fields or forests may be more apt to get foreign bodies stuck in their eyes, but even city dogs can experience this problem. And while your dog may enjoy sticking his head out the window while you&rsquo;re driving, this increases his risk of eye injury. It&rsquo;s best to keep him safely enclosed inside the car.<br /><br />Short-nosed dogs, like Pugs and Shih Tzu, tend to have slightly bulging eyes that are more prone to accidents. If you have a short-nosed breed and observe anything unusual that might be an issue, make an appointment with your veterinarian.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Provide Routine Maintenance</h2><br /><p>For routine maintenance, use <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://fourpawsnew.com/products/healthy-promise-pet-eye-cleaning-wipes" target="_blank">Four Paws<sup>&reg;</sup> Eye Wipes for Dogs &amp; Cats</a></strong>, which are specially formulated to gently remove tearstains from around the eyes. Gently wipe around the eyes and in the corners, making sure not to touch the eyeball. If you have a dog with white fur, use the wipes daily to prevent tearstains. Otherwise a few times a week is a good routine for most dogs.</p>
