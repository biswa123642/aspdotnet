        <br /><p>If your cat runs out of the room when you go to pet them, you&rsquo;re not the only one. It&rsquo;s common for cat parents to be confused by their pet&rsquo;s seemingly disinterested behavior, especially with all the love and care we provide. Fortunately, figuring out how to get your cat to like you isn&rsquo;t as challenging as it may appear. Understanding your kitty&rsquo;s needs, accommodating their desires, and providing delicious foods will help you win their admiration!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">1.	Respect Their Personal Space</h2><br /><p>If your furry friend spends most of the day out of sight, it&rsquo;s not because they despise you&mdash;they probably just want some alone time. According to <span><a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/behavior/why-your-cat-ignoring-you" target="_blank">PetMD</a></span>, cats are not social animals and don&rsquo;t need much interaction to thrive. Many cats are perfectly fine keeping to themselves most of the day and engaging with people when they want something like affection, playtime, or food.&nbsp;<br /><br />Respect your cat&rsquo;s privacy and only give attention when they want it. Don&rsquo;t hug them by force or use punishment when they don&rsquo;t respond to your command. Instead, let them come to you when they feel comfortable. Engaging on your cat&rsquo;s terms will help you fulfill their social desires and lead to snuggle sessions you&rsquo;ll both enjoy!&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">2.	Provide a Comfortable Environment</h2><br /><p>Cats have great long-term memories and tend to judge people on past interactions, so earning their trust is not always an easy feat. Offering a safe, comfortable environment is a critical first step. Make sure your cat has plenty of food and water, a warm place to sleep, toys, <span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B8AA398D7402465388B0A3317765F34A&amp;_z=z">scratching posts</a></span>, and any other items they like. <span><a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/care/litter-box-training-why-setup-and-placement-matters" target="_blank">PetMD</a></span>&nbsp;recommends providing one <span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6C9B9265BC9048679423F133627584E2&amp;_z=z">litter box</a></span>&nbsp;for each cat in your home, plus at least one more box.<br /><br /> Perfecting your cat&rsquo;s environment will likely take some trial and error. Pay attention to their behavior and provide as much access as possible to objects they adore. You should also keep your cat&rsquo;s living space clear of anything that causes stress. Many cats, for instance, do not like aluminum foil, tape, or plastic mats. Learning how to make your cat happy with their surroundings will make them more likely to treat you with love, trust, and respect. Once you figure out which items your cat prefers, it&rsquo;s important to keep them neat and orderly.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">3.	Keep Their Living Space Clean</h2><br /><p>Many pet parents know that cats are neat freaks who constantly seem to lick their paws and clean their coat. What you may not know is that your kitty wants their entire living area to be just as tidy. Clean your cat&rsquo;s litter box, bed, toys, food and water bowls, and other belongings as often as possible. Vacuum their favorite spots&mdash;preferably when they&rsquo;re not around so the loud noise doesn&rsquo;t frighten them&mdash;and establish a regular cleaning schedule.<br /><br />A well-maintained living space will benefit your cat&rsquo;s mental and physical health. Not only will regular cleaning provide peace of mind for your feline, but it can also help reduce bacteria and prevent fleas. Your cat will greatly appreciate this service and love you for showing how much you care!<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">4.	Play and Socialize Often</h2><br /><p>Playtime gives cats much-needed mental stimulation and satisfies their predatorial instincts. Plus, it helps prevent boredom and symptoms like destructive behavior, eating disorders, and depression. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to play with your cat every day and offer playthings they can pounce on and chase. Cat toys with feathers, string, rope, and other materials that resemble prey are excellent options for helping your pet indulge their urge to hunt.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to playing with your cat, you should dedicate a few minutes each day to socialization&mdash;especially when they&rsquo;re young. Pet your cat in their favorite spots, provide affection when they seek it, and offer lots of praise.<br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">5.	Offer Quality Foods</h2><br /><p>The right treats can be great sources of positive reinforcement and especially come in handy when training. Enticing your cat with a delicious snack will help them accomplish the task at hand and feel happier around you. Find some treats your cat enjoys and feed when working on a new trick or simply when you want to reward them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Similarly, you should look for wholesome and tasty options to give your kitty at mealtimes. Foods with lots of grains, proteins, and minerals are some of the most responsible options. Keep an eye on expiration dates, as many cats dislike stale foods. A healthy cat is a happy cat, and your fur kid will be grateful to you for giving them the best ingredients.<br /><br />Understanding your pet&rsquo;s wants and needs is key to learning how to get your cat to like you. Whether you&rsquo;re <span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6D8E4554B09B4D859FE2C5FD5270206C&amp;_z=z">bonding with a newly adopted cat</a>&nbsp;</span>for the first time or trying to establish a better connection with your adult cat, pay attention to their behavior and be perceptive to the things they like and don&rsquo;t like. Treat your cat with love and dignity, and they&rsquo;ll be glad to purr and cuddle with you!</p>
