        <br /><p>Dogs and kids love to play, and when you put them together, you&rsquo;ve doubled the fun. However, there must be some rules in place to keep the play safe.<br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Supervise Play</h2><br /><p>First, supervise play. Never leave a toddler alone with a dog. Very small children make quick jerking movements and high-pitched noises. Both the movement and noise can be similar to the way in which wild prey behaves and may trigger a dog to attack. Even older children should be supervised. Sometimes a child, or a dog, may get carried away with a game and start to play more roughly. That&rsquo;s when you need a time-out for both sides.&nbsp;<br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`"></h2><br /><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Games</strong></span></p> <p>Although a game of tag may seem like a good idea, and dogs love to chase, they may nip or bite if they get too excited. Consider a game of hide-and-seek instead. The dog is &ldquo;it&rdquo; in this game. To begin, have the child hide in fairly easy places. Hold the dog until the child has hidden and then tell him to find her. Occasionally, a child may need to make a noise to help direct the dog, but dogs generally catch on very quickly and have no trouble finding the children.</p> <br /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`"></h2><br /><p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Toys</span></strong></p> <p>Toys offer interactive fun as well. Many dogs love to retrieve balls, and retrieving is good, safe exercise. Make sure that the ball fits the dog; a Chihuahua can&rsquo;t manage a tennis ball, and some balls may be a choking hazard for big dogs. The Four Paws<sup>&reg;</sup> Crunch &amp; Crackle Tug can work as both an interactive toy and one that a dog may play with by himself. Many dogs enjoy tug-of-war, but again, be ready to stop the game if the dog becomes too serious. Teach your child to drop the toy if the game becomes too rough.<br /> <br /> Supervision is the key even if your dog is playing with a toy by himself. First, some dogs are very protective of items that they consider &ldquo;theirs.&rdquo; Teach your child to leave a dog alone if he has a toy and to never try to take the toy from the dog. You can teach a dog to &ldquo;drop it&rdquo; or to &ldquo;trade&rdquo; for a treat or another toy, but children shouldn&rsquo;t grab for a toy in a dog&rsquo;s mouth.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Protect Your Dog</h2><br /><p>Protect your dog during playtime. Supervise play until you know how your dog reacts to a toy. Some dogs can play with a stuffed toy for years, gently mouthing it or just carrying it around. Other dogs will destroy a stuffed toy immediately. Chew toys are the same. Some dogs can get hours of enjoyment and never destroy the toy. Other dogs rip out pieces, which may present a choking hazard. If your dog doesn&rsquo;t choke, he might still ingest part of a toy, which could lead to intestinal blockage.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> See how your dog plays with a toy before ever leaving him alone with it, and even then, check the toy&rsquo;s condition periodically. A determined canine may still be able to destroy a toy labeled &ldquo;indestructible&rdquo;.</p>
