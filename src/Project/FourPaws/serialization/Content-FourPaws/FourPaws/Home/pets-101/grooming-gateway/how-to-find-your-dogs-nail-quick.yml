        <br /><p style="text-align: justify;">From their shape to their color, dogs&rsquo; nails look vastly different from our own. It can be quite a challenge to determine how much of your dog&rsquo;s<span> nail you should trim, especially because clipping too far can cause discomfort or bleeding. Luckily, we</span>&rsquo;re here to help you identify your dog&rsquo;s &ldquo;quick,&rdquo; or the part of the nail that you should <em>not</em> cut while trimming.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Follow these tips for finding your dog&rsquo;s nail quick!</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">What is a Dog’s Quick?</h2><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">The &ldquo;quick&rdquo; is a soft cuticle that contains the blood vessel and nerves that run through your dog&rsquo;s nail. Mainly located above the nail curve, this vascular structure provides nourishment to your dog&rsquo;s nails, which allows them to grow and feel certain sensations. If you nick the quick while trimming, it can be painful for your dog and typically causes bleeding.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">If bleeding does occur, stop trimming. We recommend applying <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/products/four-paws-quick-blood-stopper-powder-and-gel" target="_blank">pet styptic powder</a> or styptic gel to the affected area to instantly control bleeding. </p> <img height="388" alt="Dog nail quick diagram" width="910" src="-/media/F30278BC396448B5B5740DF1DA62B43F.ashx" /><br /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">How to Find the Quick on Dog Nails</h2><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">If your furry friend has light-colored nails, finding the quick is relatively easy. First, gently hold your dog&rsquo;s paw in your hand. While looking down at your dog&rsquo;s semi-transparent nails, locate the pink region in the center of each nail. This pink area showing through the outside of the nail is the quick. It&rsquo;s that simple!</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">How to Find the Quick on Black Dog Nails</h2><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Locating the quick on black dog nails is a bit more difficult than it is on light-colored dog nails. From a top view, it is virtually impossible to see the quick. However, it can help to look at the bottom of your dog&rsquo;s black nails; there may be a groove on the underside that separates the hard nail from the soft cuticle. You will want to avoid trimming into the soft cuticle because it contains your dog&rsquo;s nail quick. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Another option is to shine a light, such as a small flashlight or cell phone light, on your dog&rsquo;s paws to help identify where the quick is located.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/grooming-gateway/dog-nail-care" target="_blank"><strong><span>➔ RELATED: How to Trim Your Dog&rsquo;s Nails</span></strong></a></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">How to Recede Your Dog’s Nail Quick</h2><br /><p>If your dog&rsquo;s nails are extremely long, trim a small amount and wait one week before trimming again to allow the quick to recede. You should then repeat weekly until their nails are the appropriate length.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Nailed It!</h2><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Even the most experienced pet parents know that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/grooming-gateway/why-dog-grooming-at-home-is-important" target="_blank">dog grooming</a> can be an obstacle. Whether it&rsquo;s taken care of by you, your veterinarian, or a professional groomer, regular nail trimming is important for providing your furry friend traction and avoiding uncomfortable walking and running. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to trim your dog&rsquo;s nails yourself, we hope this information helps you successfully find your dog&rsquo;s nail quick and increases your confidence as you care for your best friend! </p>
