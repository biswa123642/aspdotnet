        <br /><p>Just like people, dogs can develop joint issues, such as arthritis, as they age. Joint discomfort is very common in older dogs, larger breeds, and pets that experienced injuries. You may also need to provide <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/caring-for-elderly-and-disabled-pets" target="_blank">special care for dogs with disabilities</a> or chronic health issues.</p> <p>If your dog falls into one of these categories, or if they exhibit stiffness and poor range of motion, you may want to consider taking extra steps to promote joint health.</p> <p>In general, pets that eat a healthy, balanced diet and get daily exercise are less likely to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/arthritis-in-dogs" target="_blank">develop dog arthritis</a> until they reach old age. Depending on their ingredients, supplements can serve as preventative measures or provide relief for existing symptoms. Some products <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/products/healthy-promise-advanced-formula-hip-and-joint-supplements-for-dogs" target="_blank">provide extra-strength relief</a> for especially at-risk dogs.</p> <p>Most joint supplements come as pills or chewable tablets. Others look like dog treats and are ideal for those who don't like to take pills.</p> <p>When choosing dog joint supplements, it&nbsp; is key to not only understand the ingredients, but to choose options that provide those ingredients in the optimal dosage.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">1. Glucosamine</h2><br /><p>Glucosamine is an amino sugar compound that helps stimulate cartilage growth in dogs&rsquo; joints. Insufficient cartilage growth causes joint discomfort for dogs because it is necessary to provide a cushion between the bones. Without cartilage as padding around the joint, the bones may rub directly against one another, leading to discomfort and inflammation.</p> <p>In scientific terms, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/glucosamine-dogs-arthritis-joint-pain/" target="_blank">glucosamine supplement aids in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans</a>, which is the main building block for cartilage. These properties mean that it also aids dogs with specific issues. For example, if your pet suffers from hip dysplasia, has a spinal disc injury, or is recovering from any bone or joint-related injury, glucosamine can aid in part of their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">2. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)</h2><br /><p>Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/msm" target="_blank">form of sulfur used primarily as a pain reliever</a> and antioxidant for dogs.</p> <p>MSM acts as an antioxidant that binds with toxins and pushes them out of the body. Specifically, it helps detoxify the body on a cellular level by dissolving and flushing out free radicals. This promotes overall health regardless of your dog&rsquo;s current medical conditions.</p> <p>MSM is beneficial for reducing discomfort. It is effective for joint and hip discomfort due to arthritis. Furthermore, it limits inflammation, which can increase the level of discomfort and inhibit the dog's immune system.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h2><br /><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that can help <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://caninearthritis.org/article/overview-of-omega-3-fatty-acids-for-oa/" target="_blank">promote healthy joint lubrication</a> and reduce inflammation. They are among the most important nutrients for your dog's overall health, and supplement ingredients usually come from fish oils.</p> <p>Joint lubrication and anti-inflammatory properties directly affect a dog's arthritis. However, omega-3 fatty acids provide other benefits, as well. They can counteract other forms of inflammation in the body and improve circulation and enhance function for organs like the heart and kidneys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">4. Chondroitin Sulfate</h2><br /><p>Chondroitin sulfate is in cartilage and functions to promote water retention and elasticity. These qualities <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5356289/" target="_blank">help to ensure adequate shock absorption</a> and tissue strength around the joint. Because arthritis weakens this specific area, chondroitin sulfate is an important substance for dogs that already have or are at risk for this condition.</p> <p>Chondroitin sulfate also has preventative capabilities. It inhibits chemicals and enzymes that break down cartilage.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">5. Avocado Soybean Unsaponifiables</h2><br /><p>Avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASUs) are natural vegetable extracts made from avocado and soybean oils. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/nutraceuticals-for-joint-support-in-dogs-with-osteoarthritis" target="_blank">Avocado soybean unsaponifiables delay the progression of osteoarthritis</a> (OA) by interrupting the degeneration of cartilage and inflammation. It also counteracts the inflammation-producing COX-2 enzyme.</p> <p>In addition to protecting cartilage, ASUs speed healing after damage. Therefore, this is a useful ingredient for dogs that already have OA or other joint conditions.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">6. Turmeric</h2><br /><p>Turmeric is a spice and medicinal herb that is popular in ayurvedic medicine. Traditionally you prepare it by crushing the root of the plant, which looks similar to ginger. Turmeric has an active compound called <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/wellness/4-herbs-joint-pain-and-inflammation-pets" target="_blank">curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties</a>.</p> <p>Within the body, curcumin helps to relieve discomfort and stiffness and reduces inflammation in dogs with arthritis. Though too much turmeric can cause gastrointestinal issues in dogs, the correct dosage may provide benefits without the side effects of pharmaceutical-grade anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">7. Hyaluronic Acid</h2><br /><p>Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring acid found in your dog&rsquo;s joint connective tissue. It is responsible for water retention and the viscous consistency of the joint fluid, which helps it coat all areas of the joint to provide proper lubrication.<p> In degenerative joint disease, the concentration of hyaluronic acid is reduced, which hurts the range of motion and functionality.</p> It is possible to correct a deficiency of hyaluronic acid by using a supplement. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://theanimalhospitable.com/storage/app/media/Dog-catwatch/DogWatch2018/dogwatch-2018-11.pdf" target="_blank">Studies have found that oral supplements are effective</a>, but veterinarians may suggest injections directly into the joint area if your dog has a significant deficiency.&nbsp;<p /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Promote General Health and Use Quality Supplements </h2><br /><p>The key to encouraging overall fitness is to make play and activity part of everyday life. In addition to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/family-matters/dog-playtime" target="_blank">teaching your dog games</a> that involve physical movement, you should take the time to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/potty-time-and-training/how-to-walk-a-dog-safely" target="_blank">learn how to walk your dog safely</a> and find areas outdoors where they can run.</p> <p>It is also vital to continue <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/pets-101/health-and-wellness/exercising-dog-indoors" target="_blank">exercise indoors</a> when the weather or environment does not allow outdoor activities.</p> <p>When it comes to joint supplements, you need to ensure that the ones you choose come from a proven brand. You also need to purchase them through a reputable retailer that will answer questions that you might have and provide safe, quality products and secure shipping.</p> <p>Finally, you should discuss supplements and dosages with your veterinarian before adding them to your dog's diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
