        <br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#1: @this_girl_is_a_squirrel</h2><br /><p>Jill the pet squirrel is a 4-year-old Hurricane Isaac rescue. She poses perfectly for the cutest photos, but what’s more impressive are her videos. Jill is well trained and loves to show off her acrobatics! Her mom says she’s a “vegetarian [and] parkour expert whose only fear is the vacuum.”</p><br /><image src="~/media/88C869D47B874849A5CADB16369A23C5.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#2: @hamilton_the_hipster_cat</h2><br /><p>Who knew that a cat could have a perfectly real handlebar mustache? We can’t get enough of Hamilton the Hipster Cat’s forever-dapper look and pretty green eyes! He’s a fluffy rescue cat and probably the only Instagrammer who can accurately use the hashtag #mustachecat.</p><br /><image src="~/media/4E94F386BF1444F3BC7730E86273E37C.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#3: @bunnypigi</h2><br /><p>This is Pigi, a 4-year-old Dwarf Angora mix who’s so fluffy and small that you can barely see his eyes in many of his pics. This four-legged Instagrammer is perfect for a daily dose of bunny cuteness!</p><br /><image src="~/media/1FF6766E838846F7B3B4B9F9E8C95F66.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#4: @lionelthehog</h2><br /><p>Just pick up your phone and start following Lionel and Lilo the hedgehogs’ Instagram page—because who can resist sweet, pudgy little hedgehogs doing pretty much anything?</p><br /><image src="~/media/18F00E3E50F246ABAF4780D62287C6E9.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#5: @chinnybuddy</h2><br /><p>Mr. Bagel’s photos of him just “chinchillin’” just make you want to snuggle his lovable chubby face! This mosaic rescue chinchilla is not only cute, but also uses his page to help teach others about proper chinchilla care.</p><br /><image src="~/media/947C6A030C7C4E8D87727DE1B92ED7B7.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#6: @samhaseyebrows</h2><br /><p>Yes, there’s also a famous Instagram cat who has eyebrows! You can’t help but smile every time you look at 5-year-old Sam’s permanent look of surprise/bewilderment. His appropriate Instagram bio: “Cat model, tuna lover, heart breaker.”</p><br /><image src="~/media/4F26AD5FEAE54D2FA8C5D4D5AC3ACECB.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#7: @lifeofpikelet&nbsp;</h2><br /><p>Pikelet Butterwiggle Stoll and his parents have been a foster family to many rescue pets. “Once a puppy on death row at the pound, [Pikelet is] now rescued &amp; living it up in Sydney Australia,” according to his bio. There’s always a cute pet party at this foster home, which has housed several dogs and puppies as well as a pig and two ducks. You can support their work <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/lifeofpikelet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br /><image src="~/media/4B3853280422438EBE7F793E3407F762.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#8: @pumpkintheraccoon</h2><br /><p>This pet raccoon’s hijinks with her dog siblings make for an amazing Instagram page! She gives us a new appreciation for raccoons and how loveable they can be when raised as pets. As her bio says: “This is the story of a rescued Bahamian raccoon called Pumpkin and her friends, Royal Bahamian Potcake rescues Toffee and Oreo.”</p><br /><image src="~/media/72D5F378D15143B291B5C1EB93FAE28B.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#9: @prissy_pig</h2><br /><p>We are obsessed with pet pigs, and you simply will not find a cuter pair on Instagram. Priscilla and Poppleton are the most photogenic pigs around. They tell their followers: “We are first-grade pigs with lots of cute farm siblings! Follow our piggy adventures!”</p><br /><image src="~/media/6D2319221DED4C3FB9B5D42C57214404.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">#10: @tunameltsmyheart</h2><br /><p>We may have saved the best for last—Tuna is a 6-year-old Chiweenie with an exaggerated overbite, recessed jawline, and “a magnificent wrinkly neck.” His mom rescued him in December 2010 when he was four months old. Like his Instagram says, “If you could use a little bit of joy and laughter, you've come to the right place!”</p><br /><image src="~/media/D13C9E90147248429A11EE117BE341BD.ashx" /><br /><p /><p>We love seeing your adorable dog and cat photos! Share them with us on Instagram or Facebook by using the hashtag #PetsOfFourPaws and tagging <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fourpawsbrand">@FourPawsBrand</a> and your four-legged friend could be featured on our page!</p>
