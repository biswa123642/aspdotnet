        <br /><p>With our increasingly busy lives, sometimes a mundane activity such as dog grooming can seem like a chore. You may even assume grooming your furball isn&rsquo;t a big deal&mdash;after all, their coat looks to be in okay shape, so why bother? However, dog grooming at home benefits not only your pup, but you, too!</p><p>Before we go any further, let&rsquo;s explain what grooming actually entails. How often you should groom your dog varies from breed to breed, and it extends beyond a quick swipe with a brush. Grooming takes many different forms, whether it&rsquo;s clipping your dog&rsquo;s nails to an optimal length; cleaning their teeth for a healthy smile; wiping their ears and eyes so they can experience the world comfortably; and of course, brushing and bathing their coat to bring out its natural shine.</p><p>Learn the benefits of grooming your best friend at home and how to keep them looking and feeling their best in between visits to the grooming salon.<br /><br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Looking Good Now, Feeling Good Later</h2><br /><p>Just as brushing your teeth feels satisfying and helps minimize dental issues in the future, grooming your furry friend has a similar effect.</p> <p>For instance, regularly cleaning your pup&rsquo;s eyes with specially formulated <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=50631D1B77984A7F8ED38DC14284C96B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">pet eye wipes</a> helps wipe away existing <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=934CCBF2893B43278DC78EEFBD48731A&amp;_z=z">tear stains</a>&nbsp;and helps remove debris that could cause duct blockage. Meanwhile, combing your dog to remove small tangles on a regular basis means fewer large mats that could develop over time&mdash;saving you and your dog the frustration later.</p><br /><image src="~/media/0E12F85349604555A313379EF338FD1A.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Keeping Your Dog&rsquo;s Health in Check</h2><br /><p>Grooming is also crucial because it is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with your dog&rsquo;s body. For instance, combing your furry friend after playing in the yard doubles as a chance to inspect them for fleas and ticks. If you regularly clean your dog&rsquo;s teeth, the more likely you will realize when something looks (or smells) out of the ordinary. When you are trimming their nails, you may notice a sensitive spot in their paws.</p><p>With consistent grooming, you are better educated on any potential problems you may want to bring up to your veterinarian.</p><br /><image src="~/media/520821BFCCDE4680826C4DC671DCCC10.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Maintaining a Clean Home</h2><br /><p>Aside from helping your dog look and feel fabulous, grooming also helps keep your home clean! The more you brush and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD8F1A3548B04ACF87D78D778B02C16D&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">bathe your dog</a>, the more hair you capture in the brush or wash out during shampooing&mdash;and the less hair that will shed on your couch and rug.</p><p>Not to mention, you would most likely prefer cuddling with a freshly bathed, clean-smelling dog versus a dog who looks like they rolled through the mud a week ago.</p><br /><image src="~/media/4C246141749548F7A4F96979A63D10FD.ashx" /><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Bonding with Your Best Friend</h2><br /><p>Dog grooming at home is your chance to spend one-on-one time with your best friend (don&rsquo;t worry, the groomer will have plenty of opportunities to bond with your pup!) A <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ABAD2D6EAB884B7CA13B07662CE07AB6&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">dog grooming glove</a> is a great option for quality grooming time because it lifts excess hair while also massaging your dog for a therapeutic&mdash;and most importantly, positive&mdash;grooming experience.</p> <p>Additionally, grooming builds your pet&rsquo;s trust as you ease them through a situation that may be uncomfortable, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E6865C08B1DA404C81BC6B87E5FDFF83&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">cleaning your dog&rsquo;s ears</a>.</p> <p>When you look at each grooming task as a chance to give your furry friend some love and attention, suddenly brushing, clipping, or bathing don&rsquo;t seem like such daunting responsibilities anymore!<br />Regular grooming improves your pup&rsquo;s overall wellbeing while making life easier for you and your best friend in the long run.
