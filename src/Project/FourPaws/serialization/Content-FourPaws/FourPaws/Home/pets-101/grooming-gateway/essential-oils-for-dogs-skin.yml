        <br /><p><br>Essential oils are among the world’s most valuable resources for maintaining health and beauty. Created by distilling certain plants with water, these natural fluids provide a variety of benefits to the human body and mind. People have been using them for thousands of years. But did you know that pets can benefit from essential oils as well? Products made from these concentrated ingredients can improve a dog’s skin, coat, and even his mood.<br><br>Nothing is more unpleasant than itching, except perhaps too much scratching. Resisting the urge to scratch can be challenging for people. For dogs, though, it is usually impossible. The canine species simply doesn’t understand that scraping nails against skin is a recipe for disaster; allowing your pet to scratch can lead to redness, soreness, and even infection. If your dog’s coat has become dry or itchy, Four Paws<sup>®</sup> Magic Coat<sup>®</sup> shampoos can help.&nbsp;<br><br></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Coconut Oil</h2><br /><p>Coconuts grow in the tropical regions of the world, but their benefits reach far beyond these warm, idyllic locations. Coconut oil helps to relieve the symptoms of dry, itchy skin. Bathing your dog with <strong>Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Coconut Oil Shampoo</strong> improves a pet&rsquo;s skin and hair condition, leaving his coat smooth and shiny. This essential oil penetrates the hair well and also offers the benefit of odor control&mdash;a definite plus if your dog&rsquo;s coat has developed a foul smell.<br /> <br /></p><br /><h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`">Avocado</h2><br /><p>If guacamole tops your list of favorite foods, you certainly already know what avocados are, but did you know that this pear-shaped fruit is also an excellent moisturizer? Dogs cannot eat avocado skins, pits, stems, or leaves, but they can use the essential oil contained in the fruit itself. <strong><a>Magic Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> Avocado Oil Shampoo</a></strong> helps hydrate your pet&rsquo;s hair, soothes and nourishes his damaged skin, and relieves itchiness and dryness.</p>
