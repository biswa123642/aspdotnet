        <h2>Turtles and Tortoises</h2>
        <p>There are 461 turtle and tortoise species and they come in all sizes, from giant Leatherback Sea Turtles that can get over 7 feet long and weigh over 1,500 lbs, to the speckled tortoise that only gets 4 inches long and weighs up to 5.8 oz. Certain species of both turtles and tortoises make great pets. Tortoises are very smart and can actually learn their name. Turtles will also recognize their keepers, but mostly because they are excited you&rsquo;re bringing them food.</p>
