        <p>This month, Myke and his team start their adventure by discussing herping etiquette. Before you go field herping, always make sure to check local laws and regulations. In addition, make sure you are &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; correctly; always have something to flip with, never use your hands and always remember to flip away from yourself. It&rsquo;s very important that you leave the environment exactly the way you found it. If you can&rsquo;t put back what you flip exactly how you found it, don&rsquo;t flip it.</p>
        <p>As he was flipping through grounded coconuts, Myke had the pleasure of finding a Malaysian Pit Viper. These snakes are very common in agriculturally disturbed areas and they are ambush predators which can grow 2 to 3 feet long.</p>
        <p>During a hike up a mountain in search of a Burmese Python, Myke and his team also find a Malayan Racer. These snakes also go by the name Black Copper Rat Snakes; they are nocturnal and grow to about 4 to 6 feet long. They can be found in forest clearings and edges and feed on small mammals and herpetofauna.</p>
        <p>At long last the team finally manage to find a Burmese Python. The average size for one of these snakes is about 12 - 20 feet long, they are terrestrial and prey on large mammals and birds. Burmese Pythons are ornate snakes, which makes them attractive to the leather trade and this has lead to rampant poaching in the wild. Luckily, they are a protected species in Indonesia, which is why Myke does not touch the one he finds.</p>

        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Basking Temperature: 92.3&deg;F (88&deg;F - 92&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 79.8&deg;F (75&deg;F - 80&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 89.1% (70% - 95% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Copper Rats need tree bark and mulch to recreate the natural substrate of their habitat. They are very active predators and the wrong substrate can lead to problems with feeding.</p>
        <p>Burmese Pythons are large snakes that live in very humid environments which means they need a lot of water. A large water bowl in your terrarium is a must, as is providing a bedding that can hold moisture.</p>
        <p>When a snake this size eats a big meal, it needs a lot of heat to digest its meal, so be sure it has optimal basking temperatures. A Burmese Python is an advanced keeper species, and definitely not a good choice for beginners.</p>
