        <p>Season 2, Episode 10: Calabar Python<br />
        <br />
        This episode of Beyond the Glass takes us to the tropical highland of Togo, as Myke and the crew venture out to encounter the Calabar Python (Calabaria reinhardtii).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The habitat in which the search begins offers shelter to a variety of animals, including slippery frogs, chameleons, gaboon vipers, and more. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Myke would find the first creature of the night &ndash; a Necas&rsquo; Chameleon (Chamaeleo necasi).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Despite finding this guy at night, Necas&rsquo; Chameleons are diurnal. They&rsquo;re also so rare that this may have been the first time they&rsquo;ve ever been filmed! In fact, they were discovered for the first time in 2007. Unfortunately, due to forests being cut down and farming starting to eat up their habitat, Necas&rsquo; Chameleons are in danger of going extinct if conservancy efforts aren&rsquo;t put in place.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Myke found another animal, this time one slithering along the leafy forest floor. This would be the African File Snake (Meheyla poensis). Why are they called a File Snake? Their scales are comprised of a rough filed feel that goes all the way down the snake&rsquo;s back. Another interesting fact about File Snakes is that their scales don&rsquo;t overlap! This means that they&rsquo;re prone to dehydration, and can also get skin infections from too moist of substrate. An incredibly gentle animal, it&rsquo;s rare that File Snakes act out in defense against anybody.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        From there, the scenery would change. After poking around in the savannahs, the team now found themselves in an entirely different ecosystem filled with creeks and streams. It&rsquo;d be in this area in which Myke would find the next animal resting on a mossy rock &ndash; a Giant Tailless Whip Scorpion (Damon diadema). An imposing creature with its large feelers, these guys are harmless! They don&rsquo;t have venom and they don&rsquo;t have stingers. They just have their creepy appearance!<br />
        <br />
        Myke would then come across the snake he started the trek searching for &ndash; the Calabar Python. Though it&rsquo;s part of the name, these guys aren&rsquo;t actually pythons! They also have a lot of traits similar to other snakes. They lack heat pits like a sand boa, they have a tail like a rubber boa,&nbsp; and will ball up like a ball python if they are disturbed. Due to using their tail as a defense mechanism, Calabar Pythons will rarely bite.&nbsp;<br />
