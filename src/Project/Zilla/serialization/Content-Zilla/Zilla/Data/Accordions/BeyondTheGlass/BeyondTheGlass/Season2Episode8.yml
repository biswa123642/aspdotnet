        <p>Season 2, Episode 8: Graceful Chameleon<br />
        <br />
        This month&rsquo;s episode of Beyond the Glass takes us to a beautiful spot &ndash; the grasslands of west Africa. Here, we get a completely different set of animals than you would in the highlands or the tropics, further solidifying the unique diversity of biomes within the western part of the continent. In this episode, Myke and the crew seek out the Graceful Chameleon.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Battling the heat and slim amounts of shelter, Myke gravitates towards what actual shade does exist. There, he finds his first animal &ndash; a Belle&rsquo;s Hinge-Back Tortoise (Kinixys belliana). Why are they called Hinge-Backs? They have a unique ability to close the area between the shell and their back legs. Unfortunately, this species is threatened by its grasslands being converted into farms and locals capturing them. The locals believe that the tortoise can cast away evil from those who possess it, making it the Exorcism Tortoise&hellip;which is pretty cool!<br />
        <br />
        From there, Myke would find what he came to search for &ndash; the Graceful Chameleon (Chamaeleo Gracilis). Now this is a fascinating animal! Contrary to popular belief, a chameleon&rsquo;s color-changing ability isn&rsquo;t what most people think it is. It won&rsquo;t change the color of whatever object it&rsquo;s sitting on. Instead, it works with light. Some chameleons may change when in self-defense. They will also change depending on their mood, similar to a mood ring! This is also a way to know if your chameleon is healthy.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Chameleons eyes can also look in different directions. One will typically be looking ahead while the other peers behind. However, when a chameleon is feeding, they will lock their eyes on its prey &ndash; sorry, grasshoppers!&nbsp;<br />
