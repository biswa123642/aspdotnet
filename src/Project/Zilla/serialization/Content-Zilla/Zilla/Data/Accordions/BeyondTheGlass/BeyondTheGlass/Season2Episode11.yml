        <p>Season 2, Episode 11: West African Reed Frog<br />
        <br />
        Heavy rainfall caused this month&rsquo;s herping excursion to start off on the wrong foot!&nbsp; However, there was a silver lining. The rain made it a great opportunity to search for amphibians.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Things would eventually clear up and the team resumed their search in the night. Togo has great amphibian diversity, which provides ideal conditions to find the target of the evening &ndash; the West African Reed Frog.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The first frog Myke would discover was the Striped Reed Frog (Hyperolius semidiscus). If there was ever an award for the cutest small frog, these guys are definitely in the running. While amazing, it was only one of many species in the area, so after it hopped off Myke&rsquo;s finger, the hunt resumed.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Myke came across the next animal, an African Giant Snail (Achatina fuliga). African Giant Snails are illegal to possess in the United States due to the risk they pose to agriculture. Coming in between 4-8 inches, they reside in damp foliage and humid forest floors. Their diet consists of plant matter and their system is terrestrial/arboreal.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The second giant creature Myke would find while looking for tiny frogs is an African Giant Millipede (Archispirosstreptus gigas). This is an animal that people may be familiar with, as they are popular pets in the US. Known to grow up to a foot long, this species makes its home in rotting wood. This provides them a healthy diet of decaying matter.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The animals would keep coming with the next one having eight legs, as Myke would discover an African Golden-Rumped Wolf Spider (Africactenus pegilus). Coming in at a size of 4-7 inches, the head is similar to that of a tarantula. Their natural habitat consists of dead trees and humid leaf litter, while they prey on invertebrates.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Since the recent rain helped to bring the amphibians out, the next find was another amazing moisture loving animal, a West African Toad (Amietophrynus togoensis). Myke found it right in its natural habitat &ndash; the moist forest floor. These guys can grow to be decently sized at up to six inches. Their diet mainly consists of small invertebrates.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The amphibians would continue as the trek moved onward, with the unique Shovel Snout Frog (Hemisus marmoratus) making an appearance next. It looks exactly like it sounds &ndash; with a pointy-faced nose. It&rsquo;s rare to see these guys in their natural habitat of moist soil, as they only really make an appearance after a rainfall. Shovel Snout Frogs are termite specialists, which means they spend a majority of their time underground. If kept as a pet, it&rsquo;s vital to make sure that their bedding isn&rsquo;t soaking wet. However, it does need to have humidity and needs to be deep, as these guys love to burrow.<br />
        <br />
        With his eyes in the trees, Myke&rsquo;s eye is caught by one of Africa&rsquo;s most dangerous venomous snakes, the Boomslang (Dispholidus typus). Unfortunately, this iconic African snake was in a position that it wasn&rsquo;t able to be taken down safely, so Myke decided to move on.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        At long last, Myke would come across the targeted animal for the night &ndash; the West African Reed Frog (Hyperolius laticeps). This is a frog that comes with loads of personality, despite their small size. If kept in captivity, a planted tank would be a great home, as their biome consists of tall grass and creeksides.&nbsp;<br />
