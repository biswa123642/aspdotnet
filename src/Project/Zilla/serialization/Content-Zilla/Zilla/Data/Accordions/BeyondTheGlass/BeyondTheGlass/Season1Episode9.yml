        <p>In this episode, Myke heads out to find an animal as mythological as its name &ndash; the Dragon Snake.</p>
        <p>As he begins his search in a shallow creek, he quickly comes across two species of frogs. The first is a newly metamorphosized Kuhl&rsquo;s Creek Frog. At this size, it resembles prey for the Dragon Snake that Myke is searching for. Shortly after, he encounters a Javan Horned Frog. This species is a master at camouflage with its strong resemblance of a leaf. This comes in handy since they are not too nimble with their movements.</p>
        <p>As his adventure continues, Myke finds what he was looking for. Hidden away in the rocky edges of the creek, he encounters the very rare Dragon Snake. The three pronounced ridges along its back is just part of what makes these snakes so unique. Dragon Snakes are a bit mysterious and much of their ecology, breeding, and more remain unknown. All in all, this discovery ended up making Myke&rsquo;s year.</p>
        <p>The team had such great success at the creek during the night that they decided to go back to the same spot in the daytime. That is when they came across a Malaysian Blue Coral Snake. They have a bright red underbelly and a blue top, making it a very unique looking snake. Like a Ring-necked Snake, this species curls its tail when it senses danger.</p>

        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p><strong>Ambient Temperature:</strong> 75.3&deg;F (72&deg;F - 82&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p><strong>Humidity Percentage:</strong> 95.2% (80% - 95% Range)</p>
        <p><strong>Night Temperature:</strong> 73.1&deg;F (72&deg;F - 78&deg;F Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>In terms of captivity, almost nobody has had luck with the Dragon Snake. They are not well understood, so they have only been brought into captivity a few times.</p>
        <p>The Javan Horned Frog&rsquo;s setup in captivity is similar to the Malaysian Horned Frog, which is more commonly kept in the pet trade.</p>
