        <p>In this episode, Myke travels to a rice paddy in Indonesia in search of a Radiated Rat Snake, whose captive bred cousins are a very popular pet in the US. Along the way, another local snake works his way into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Radiated Rat Snakes are hardy animals who do well in captivity, and can adapt to lots of habitats. On average, this type of snake can grow to 4-6 feet long. While this particular snake was found in a rice paddy, they also thrive in forests. Radiated Rat Snakes enjoy feeding on small mammals and smaller reptiles. These snakes are a member of the Colubridae family, which is the largest family of snakes. While most colubrids are non-venomous there are some dangerous exceptions like the African Boomslang.</p>
        <p>In search of a Radiated Rat Snake, Myke also runs into a Javan Spitting Cobra. The average size for this cobra is about 4-5 feet long. They can often be found on the jungle floor, or in farmlands like the one Myke is exploring. They eat small mammals and other smaller snakes.</p>

        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Basking Temperature: 91.2&deg;F (88&deg;F - 95&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 79.4&deg;F (75&deg;F - 82&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 83.5% (70 - 90% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>While snakes are not as prone to UV related metabolic bone issues as lizards, more recent findings suggest it may still be necessary for many diurnal species.</p>
        <p>Basking is important not just for heat but also for UV. UVA and UVB are vital for everything from digestion to calcium absorption. When you buy a UV bulb, be sure to mark the box so you know when it&rsquo;s time to change it.</p>
