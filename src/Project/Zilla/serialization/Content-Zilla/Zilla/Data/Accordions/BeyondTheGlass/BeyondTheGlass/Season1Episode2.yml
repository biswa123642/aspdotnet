      Hint: Content
      Value: |
        <p>In this episode, Myke travels to a river in Java, an island of Indonesia, in search of a water monitor. Water monitors are one of the largest, and arguably most intelligent, lizard species on Earth. The average size for a water monitor is about three to six feet long. The one Myke finds is still young and will grow larger. Water monitors can be found in riverbanks and swamps and feed on fish and semi-aquatic animals.</p>
        <p>Water monitors have thick paddle tails which help them move quickly through the water. They are also very good at climbing trees and moving swiftly across land. This makes them a fascinating predator to study.</p>
        <p>Water monitors are not a beginner pet because they grow quite large and need a lot of space. In fact, their enclosure requires three microhabitats: water to swim, a large climbing area and an additional space for basking.</p>
        <p>During this adventure, Myke also finds a black marsh turtle, a neighbor of the water monitor. These turtles grow to about 7-8 inches and live in marshes and muddy rivers where they feed on invertebrates.</p>
        <div class="takeaways">
        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Basking Temperature: 90&deg;F (88&deg;F - 95&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 75&deg;F (75&deg;F - 82&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 90% (70 - 90% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>A turtle will pollute its own water much faster than most fish species, making it important to have a heavy duty turtle or reptile filter in your enclosure. In addition, cold water can make even the healthiest of reptiles lethargic, so be sure to maintain appropriate aquatic temperatures.</p>
