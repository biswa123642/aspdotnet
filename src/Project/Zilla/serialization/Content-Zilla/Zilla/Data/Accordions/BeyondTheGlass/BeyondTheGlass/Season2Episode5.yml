        <p>In the latest episode of Beyond the Glass, Myke and his crew venture out to find a fascinating creature &ndash; the House Snake (Boaedon fuliginosus).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The adventure begins as the sun sets and a familiar chorus courtesy of Straw-Colored Fruit Bats (Eidolon helvum) starts to make its way through the forest. Unlike other bats, this species does not live in caves, but rather in trees. In this area of Africa, they are revered due to the locals&rsquo; belief that they helped their ancestors escape from slavery.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        As night falls, the team heads out on the search for snakes. It would not take them long to find one, as they quickly came across a Black Tree Snake (Thraspops jacksonii). This species can be a bit timid, and they require a lot of room when kept in captivity. While not ideal for everyone, these snakes can provide a fun and unique challenge for the more seasoned reptile keeper.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Myke then spots out a trail left by another snake in the wet mud of the forest. This leads them to a snake they were not anticipating on finding &ndash; an African Forest Cobra (Naja melanoleuca melanolueca). Forest Cobras are an intelligent and feisty species. These guys are nothing to mess with, as they can be quite combative when being handled and are highly venomous.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The team then discovers what they came to find &ndash; a House Snake (Boaedon fuliginosus). They were given this name due to their close living with humans. Very similar to the North American Rat and Corn Snakes, they are active but not real nippy and make a great beginner snake. One important fact to note is that the House Snake has a large appetite and will eat nearly any food if offered. It is crucial to not overfeed this snake.&nbsp;</p>
