        <p>In the latest adventure of Beyond the Glass, Myke and the team embark out on an exciting challenge &ndash; to find the largest lizard in Africa, the Nile Monitor (<em>Varanus niloticus</em>).</p>
        <p>The banks of a creek in Togo is where the search begins.  These amazing large monitors spend time in these areas hunting for prey, so they make the perfect habitat to begin our search. However, the Nile Monitor is not the first animal Myke spots. Instead, they come across an African Side-Neck Turtle (<em>Pelomedusa Subrufa</em>), only after Myke slightly damages his microphone in the process.</p>
        <p>This species is referred to as the Hinged Side-Neck Turtle, as, like a Box Turtle, it can close its shell. Their personality makes them a fantastic pet to keep. Another benefit of Side-Neck Turtles is their manageable size, in comparison to other turtle species such as the Red-Eared Slider. Side-Necks are also allowed to be kept in all states as a pet!</p>
        <p>The hunt then resumes for the Nile Monitor. Eventually, Myke discovers a baby on the trunk of a fallen palm tree, revealing its gorgeous pattern of colors.</p>
        <p>Though the one Myke catches is young and small, this species will grow to be an average of 5-7 feet, making it the largest lizard in all of Africa. In the wild, the Nile Monitor has multiple basking levels. Closer to the water, it will be cooler than higher up on the top of the rocks. If this lizard is kept in captivity, it&rsquo;s encouraged to offer the same amenities it has in the wild, but include an option for the animal to escape the heat altogether.</p>
        <p>Multiple hiding spots are necessary, as it prevents them from becoming stressed. Climbing areas are also a must, as this species enjoys being active. Lastly, clean water is needed, as its one of the biggest appreciations that the Nile Monitor has.</p>
