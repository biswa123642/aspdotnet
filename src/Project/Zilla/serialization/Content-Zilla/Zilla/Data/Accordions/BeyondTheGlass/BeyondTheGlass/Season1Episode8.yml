        <p>In this episode, Myke and his team set out to study the Reticulated Python.</p>
        <p>As Myke and his team explored the area, they came across tracks that indicated they were actually on the trail of one of two snakes, either an Enhydris Snake or Homalopsis Snake, both of which are very common in this part of Indonesia. They quickly found a baby Homalopsis, more commonly known as a Puff Faced Water Snake. These fully aquatic snakes belong to the family of Mud Snakes. Unfortunately, there is a lot of pressure on the wild population of this snake because they are heavily hunted for their skin and their meat.</p>
        <p>Before long, they stumbled on another fully aquatic snake of the same Mud Snake family, a Rainbow Water Snake. These little guys are fish eaters and grow to an average size of 2.5 feet.</p>
        <p>After a little digging, Myke finally found what he was looking for, a Reticulated Python. These pythons are the longest snakes in the world, growing to an average size of 15 to 28 feet long. The tunnel where the snake was found was about 10 feet long, and the it was on the smaller end of the spectrum. If you were to keep a snake like this at home, your habitat space would need to be considerably larger than that of a typical pet snake. The Reticulated Python feeds on large mammals and birds, so you&rsquo;d also need a generous budget for rabbits and other prey.</p>

        <p><em>Concerning the habitat of Puff Faced Water Snake and Rainbow Water Snakes</em>. These snakes require very clean water, even the slightest contamination can lead to bacterial or fungal issues. Both snakes rarely leave the water, but it&rsquo;s still important to provide these snakes with a suitable area to leave the water and dry off.</p>
        <p>Many aquatic snakes have fast metabolisms and should have live food readily available.</p>
        <p>Reticulated Pythons are not the ideal pet for most hobbyists and require a lot of space, knowledge and funds to be cared for properly. If you&rsquo;re up to the challenge, these pythons can be a very rewarding species to care for.</p>
        <p>When it comes to large snakes like Reticulated Pythons, heating mats are a great way to provide them with the heat they need. If glass enclosures are used at any point, be sure that the enclosure retain sufficient humidity. Reticulated pythons are primarily terrestrial, and floor space is more important than height.</p>
