        <p>Season 2, Episode 7: African Egg Eating Snake<br />
        <br />
        This was an exciting episode of Beyond the Glass! Myke and the team were out on the search in the dead of night for the ruthless and toothless African Egg Eating Snake, a snake that&rsquo;s found in areas with lots of birds.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The first snake the crew came across was the Savanna Stiletto Snake (Atractaspis dahomeyensis). Myke is no stranger to this feisty and highly venomous critter, just ask his left hand and its missing thumb!! Seriously!! He&rsquo;s actually missing a thumb, and he was kind enough to share the pictures of it in the episode. You&rsquo;ve been warned!&nbsp; With its side sweeping fangs, Stilettos are not a snake to mess around with. They&rsquo;re not recommended as pets and are better off left in the wild.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Myke&rsquo;s next big moment is one that focuses on a small nut, but a nut that contains palm oil. Palm oil is such a large ecological issue and can be found nearly everywhere in your house &ndash; from chips to cosmetics to soaps and shampoos. Palm oil comes at the expense of thousands and thousands of rainforest acres. In turn, it destroys the habitats of hundreds of animals. If you&rsquo;re interested further in this issue, there are groups such as the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil that are fighting the good fight in the combat against it.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        After climbing an ant-filled tree, Myke would encounter what he and the team braved the night to search for &ndash; the African Egg Eating Snake (Dasypeltis scabra). When intimidated, Egg Eaters will flatten their head and make a heart-shaped bend. However, they&rsquo;re actually&nbsp; toothless and dentally impaired &ndash; all bark, no bite! These guys got their name from the ability to swallow eggs whole. They can do this due to their internal spine that cracks the egg, and then they spit the shell out! It truly is incredible how this species has adapted to its diet of just eggs.&nbsp;<br />
