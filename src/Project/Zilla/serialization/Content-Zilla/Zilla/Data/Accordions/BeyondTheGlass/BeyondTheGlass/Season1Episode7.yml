        <p>This holiday season, we want to thank the conservationists around the world who dedicate their lives to saving reptiles. So in this episode, Myke and his team headed to the Ciliwung Reptile Center to meet with Nathan, a friend and fellow conservationist, to talk about his work protecting reptiles and educating others in his community.</p>
        <p>A part of Nathan&rsquo;s work in the community is making house calls to safely relocate reptiles that find their way into people&rsquo;s homes. During Myke&rsquo;s interview with Nathan, they received a call out to retrieve a snake in someone&rsquo;s home.</p>
        <p>The snake they were sent to retrieve was a Green Rat Snake, who as it turns out, was gravid. Gravid means she is carrying eggs, so the team was extra careful not to stress her out too much. Myke and Nathan safely relocated the expecting mother to a bamboo forest, which is the ideal home for both her and her young.</p>
        <p>Green Rat Snakes are a non-venomous rat snake which grow to an average size of 5-6 feet long. They are a diurnal species, which means they are active during the day and they are very common throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
        <div class="takeaways">
        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Basking Temperature: 88.4&deg;F (88&deg;F - 94&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 75.6&deg;F (74&deg;F - 82&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 77.1% (60% - 90% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>As Myke inspected the ground, he noticed that while the top layer was fairly dry, as he dug down, there was plenty of moisture below. This suggests that as you build the perfect environment for Green Rat Snakes, you should consider doing a layered substrate.</p>
        <p>Once Myke released the Green Rat Snake, it went right for the bamboo to seek shelter, so be sure to provide a lot of cover and plenty for the snake to climb on.</p>
