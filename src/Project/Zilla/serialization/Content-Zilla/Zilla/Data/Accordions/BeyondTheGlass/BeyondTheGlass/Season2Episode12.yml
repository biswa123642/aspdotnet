        <p>Season 2, Episode 12: African Rock Python&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The season finale of Beyond the Glass is upon us, and it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for the action to get started. Myke begins the quest in a waterway in the forest, as he&rsquo;s searching for the largest snake in west Africa &ndash; the African Rock Python.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        It was a gorgeous day, as the sun shined through the green jungle leaves, providing perfect basking spots for the animals. The first creature Myke would find would be the Herald Snake (Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia). An amphibian specialist, this snake uses its rear fangs to capture its prey. They will use those fangs to puncture inflated frogs, neutralizing the frogs&rsquo; defense mechanism. A docile and friendly animal, there isn&rsquo;t a lot to be afraid of with the Herald Snake.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        As Myke continued to venture onward, he&rsquo;d come across a patch of bamboo. Bamboo offers great habitats for animals, including the one the team would spot next &ndash; the African Twig Snake (Thelotornis kirtlandii). A distinct feature of these guys is their venom. If bitten by this snake, it could cause a human to bleed from everywhere --&nbsp; out your ears, eyes, gums &ndash; you name it. For that reason, it&rsquo;s important to note that these snakes aren&rsquo;t recommended to be kept as pets.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Myke would then spot the snake he was looking for &ndash; the African Rock Python (Python sebae). It was residing in a pool of muddy water in a cleared out area of the jungle, but with no visibility, it took a little bit for Myke to find it. These guys are the biggest pythons in all of Africa and love a big pool of water. They can sometimes have a small temper, which is what this one exhibited, as it was clear it was camera shy.&nbsp;<br />
