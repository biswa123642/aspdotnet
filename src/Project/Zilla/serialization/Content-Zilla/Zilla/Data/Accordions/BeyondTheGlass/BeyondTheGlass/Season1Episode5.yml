        <p>In this spooky Halloween special Myke and his team travel to Bogor, a city in West Java, in search of a Tokay Gecko. They choose a city for their search because these geckos, often called cosmopolitan geckos, don&rsquo;t mind the human disturbance.</p>
        <p>During the search, a House Gecko worked his way into the spotlight. These little guys are arboreal and grow to an average size of 2 - 4 inches. They like to live in rotting trees and buildings!</p>
        <p>Eventually, their search took them to a graveyard where the team was very careful to be respectful of both the geckos and the dead. Tokays are very talkative, which helped Myke in his search. Tokay Geckos are a nocturnal species that grow to an average size of 9 - 13 inches long and are commonly found in tree trunks. They are both arboreal and terrestrial. These geckos are a very durable and adaptable species, which makes them well suited for captivity.</p>
        <div class="takeaways">
        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Ambient Temperature: 88.6&deg;F (82&deg;F - 92&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 73.1&deg;F (72&deg;F - 75&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 82.2% (65% - 90% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>It&rsquo;s important to note that it is really humid in this environment, and the House Geckos kept appearing on walls with moss. Like most tropical geckos, House Geckos and Tokay Geckos need tall enclosures with room to climb.</p>
        <p>For both of these geckos, substrates that retain and hold humidity are recommended.</p>
