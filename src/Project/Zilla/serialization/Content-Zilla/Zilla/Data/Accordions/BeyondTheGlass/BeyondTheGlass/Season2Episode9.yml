        <p>Season 2, Episode 9: Ball Python<br />
        <br />
        The latest Beyond the Glass Episode is here &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a special one, as this month sees Myke and the crew seek out one of the most popular pet snakes out there: the Ball Python (Python regius).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Rather than searching in thick jungle bush, Myke begins the quest in a grassier and more-open habitat. However, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a ball python that Myke would first find, but rather, a Red Headed Agama (Agama agama). While this one isn&rsquo;t fully colored yet, males will develop a famous color pattern that consists of bright blues and a red-head &ndash; hence its name. When these guys absorb heat, they also brighten their colors. This means that UVA and UVB are both crucial in their habitat.<br />
        <br />
        Myke would then find a very unique &ldquo;castle,&rdquo; but not one Prince Charming lives in.&nbsp; This castle was made by Mound Building Termites (Macrotermes sp.) The rocky structure provides a great habitat for some gecko and scorpion species, as well as ball pythons. They also serve as great incubators. A lot of monitor species will break in, lay their eggs, and when the babies are born, they have termites to eat!<br />
        <br />
        Soon, the sun would disappear from the sky, and the search for ball pythons continued into the night &ndash; and it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Myke finally came across one. While extremely popular as pets in the United States, ball pythons are revered as Gods in Ghana. Not only do they serve a large role in the cultural part of West Africa, but agriculture as well, due to their steady diets of feasting on mice and other rodents that disrupt farmers. A shy and nervous species, these guys are incredibly docile and make a terrific first pet.&nbsp;<br />
