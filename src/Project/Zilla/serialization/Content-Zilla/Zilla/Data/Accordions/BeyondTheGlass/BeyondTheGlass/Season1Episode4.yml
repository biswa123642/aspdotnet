        <p>Myke and his team pulled an all-nighter in search of a nocturnal species, the Kuhl&rsquo;s Flying Gecko. While on the search, Myke found a Tailless Whip Scorpion! These little guys may be freaky looking, but they are actually pretty harmless as they don&rsquo;t bite or sting.</p>
        <p>The team then encountered a White-Lipped Viper, an arboreal snake, about to ambush his prey. These snakes feed on small mammals, prefer heavy brush and orchard biomes, and grow to about 2 - 3 feet long.</p>
        <p>Once the Kuhl&rsquo;s Flying Gecko was found, Myke was able to get a good look at the gecko&rsquo;s webbed toes, frilled tail and extra skin on his stomach. These physical traits help this little gecko glide from tree to tree!</p>
        <p>Like the White-Lipped Viper, the Kuhl&rsquo;s Flying Gecko is arboreal, which means they live in trees and are not commonly found on the ground.</p>

        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Ambient Temperature: 82.3&deg;F (78&deg;F - 88&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Night Temperature: 73.1&deg;F (70&deg;F - 75&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p>Humidity: 87.2% (70% - 95% Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>The gecko&rsquo;s natural environment is filled with overlapping trees, so it&rsquo;s important to keep this in mind as you build an enclosure. Always make sure it&rsquo;s easy for your gecko to jump from one perch to another, and give them plenty to climb on.</p>
        <p>Due to the thin nature of this gecko, it&rsquo;s very important that their terrarium doesn&rsquo;t get too hot, or they may overheat.</p>
        <p>When building an enclosure for a Tailless Whip Scorpion, maintaining the right humidity level is key, because these invertebrates can dry out quickly. In addition, be sure to purchase an enclosure with plenty of vertical space.</p>
