        <p>In the latest Beyond the Glass adventure, Myke and his team go on the search for arachnids. While these are not the most cuddliest animals to have as a pet, they sure are fascinating.</p>
        <p>Starting out in a field full of ants, Myke uncovers a Vinegaroon, also known as a Whip Tail Scorpion. Though it technically falls under the category of an arachnid, it is not a true scorpion. The vinegaroon does not have a stinger, making it totally harmless. Found in moist, dark areas, these guys love to hide away under fallen logs and brush piles.</p>
        <p>The adventure continues through nightfall, with the team utilizing a blacklight to help encounter the unique wildlife. The next exciting find was a juvenile one-of-a-kind Sunbeam Snake. The skin of this snake boasts a prism of color, resulting in a fascinating look. In fact, in Cambodia, they are referred to as &ldquo;Gasolina,&rdquo; since their characteristics resemble gasoline on the ground.</p>
        <p>It would not be long after that Myke found what he was looking for &ndash; the Asian Forest Scorpion. Though this species features a big pair of pinchers, they are typically not the most dangerous scorpion. These guys love to burrow. In the wild, they will come out, grab a little dinner, then go back to bed.</p>

        <h3>Habitat Takeaways:</h3>
        <p><strong>Ambient Temperature:</strong> 84.3&deg;F (82&deg;F - 92&deg;F Range)</p>
        <p><strong>Humidity Percentage:</strong> 85.7% (75% - 90% Range)</p>
        <p><strong>Night Temperature:</strong> 75.2&deg;F (72&deg;F - 78&deg;F Range)</p>
        </div>
        <p>In the pet trade, scorpions thrive in a moist environment since they tend to be found under debris. When setting up their habitat, make sure to provide a substrate that retains moisture. Be sure to include ample hiding spaces as well.</p>
        <p>The Sunbeam Snake can be quite popular at reptile shows or pet stores. They are relatively easy to care for and make great pets due to their docile behavior. Their overly-friendly characteristics also make this snake great for educational purposes.</p>
