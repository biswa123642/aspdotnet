        <h2>Small but Bitey!</h2>
        <p>Mud and Musk turtles are small aquatic turtles that spend their time in the mud at the bottom of ponds or stagnant bodies of water.&nbsp; These small turtles usually have large heads that they use to ambush and grab prey as it walks or swims by.&nbsp; With incredible jaw strength they are able to capture insects, fish, worms, frogs, and any other aquatic animal that gets close enough to their powerful jaws.&nbsp; Mud turtles get their namesake because they spend much of their time in the mud, but musk turtles get their name from a musky smell they emit from glands when threatened.&nbsp; Due to their more stagnant nature, small adult size, and easy habitat requirements, these are amazing and quirky turtles to keep as pets.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Mud and Musk Turtles are found in slow or still freshwater habitats.&nbsp; These turtles prefer permanent bodies of water rather than flood zones or vernal ponds.&nbsp; Many enthusiasts find these turtles throughout the east and southern portion of the United States, but they can be found north up into Wisconsin.&nbsp; Specific ranges vary depending on the species.&nbsp; Habitats vary drastically from one end of their range to the other, but they inhabit the same niches no matter where they are found.&nbsp; They are rather aquatic and prefer water that has gradients of depth.&nbsp; Provide them with a proper basking spot, but don&rsquo;t be concerned if they don&rsquo;t use it very often. </p>
        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>While these turtles start out the size of a ping pong ball, they can reach sizes of 4-6&rdquo; depending on the species and will require large aquatic environments as adults despite their small stature due to their activity.&nbsp; For turtles 4-6&rdquo; an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aqueon.com/products/aquariums/standard-glass-rectangle-aquariums" target="_blank">Aqueon 40BR aquarium</a>&nbsp;or larger is necessary to provide the space needed for your turtle.&nbsp; These turtles spend very little time on land and usually only come out of the water to bask under their lights.&nbsp; Provide them a dry basking site out of the water to allow these turtles to fully dry off and warm up.&nbsp; This will keep your pet turtle&rsquo;s skin and shell healthier.&nbsp; A unique and realistic looking option for a basking site is the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6602587142F84E6CBDF9364703DB095B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Log Landing and Zilla Turtle Trunk</a>.&nbsp; The majority of the turtle&rsquo;s environment is water, and turtles produce a lot of waste, so keeping it clean can be a challenge.&nbsp; Mechanical and chemical filtration is necessary.&nbsp; Filters such as the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7B11930453D14894BD59D6341700C5C0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Basking Platform&nbsp;Filters</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=378991DC142841AF83E38C296A686AAB&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Aquatic Reptile Internal Filter</a>&nbsp;make great options for volumes of water up to 40 Gallons, but over that you&rsquo;ll need an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aqueon.com/products/filters-media/quietflow-canister-filters" target="_blank">Aqueon QuietFlow Canister Filter</a>.&nbsp; Make sure to do a 50% water change every month to remove waste and add <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DF440E8E5517498C89159DE735664825&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Water Conditioner</a>&nbsp;to the new water.&nbsp; Depending on the filtration, size of the enclosure, and your pet, you may need to change the water more frequently.&nbsp; Adding a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3597445E8F16419DA569790152AF4E98&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Fresh Air Screen Cover</a>&nbsp;to prevent your turtle from escaping is essential for maintaining your pet&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; They are much better climbers than you think and you don&rsquo;t want the household cat to play in the water either!</p>
        <h2>Temperature and Lighting</h2>
        <p>Although Musk and Mud Turtles are aquatic, spending most of their time in the water, they still require a thermal gradient in the air temperature.&nbsp; In the wild, things like tree limbs and leaves overhead create different temperature areas to bask in based on shadows.&nbsp; To replicate that in the terrarium, create a heated basking site on one end, and other sites to get out of the water throughout the habitat.&nbsp; These turtles need temperatures approximately 85&deg;F-95&deg;F to bask under with species from southern regions requiring higher temperatures, and a gradient down to 75&deg;F on the cool end.&nbsp; This can be created with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AF90759147EC4EDB80C809B354870AD7&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Incandescent Spot Bulbs</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D3702069ED2146608ED4F6B8EA19DE6E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Mini 25W or 50W Halogen Bulbs</a>.&nbsp; It is important to monitor your pet&rsquo;s enclosure temperatures using a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FD3BCC02681B432BB4F56F66DDC6E80B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Digital Thermometer.</a>&nbsp; An incredibly important and too often forgotten lighting need is UVA and UVB.&nbsp; Make sure to provide access to UVA and UVB over the basking platforms using any <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=82DFF8E91CC446FCB8F6E0FACD4E4422&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Fluorescent Tropical 25 UVA/UVB bulb</a>.&nbsp; For more information on UV lighting, read &ldquo;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CCE5A59715A848A0B88825621E9BE3B4&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Understanding UVA, UVB, and UVC Reptile Lighting</a>.&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
        <p>In the wild these Mud and Musk turtles are omnivores and scavengers eating insects, fish, worms, crayfish, and occasionally plant matter.&nbsp; One of the easiest things about keeping a turtle as a pet is feeding them.&nbsp; Not only is it fun to interact with them during feeding, but <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ADFA74988F3745119E9E24C165E5A85C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Fortified Aquatic Turtle Food </a>makes keeping food on hand and feeding easy.&nbsp; Only feed your turtle as many pellets as it can eat in 15 minutes.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re able to, clear out any uneaten food after that time.&nbsp; You can also offer your turtle fresh water fish that has been frozen-thawed and earth worms.</p>
        <h2>Handling</h2>
        <p>Handling Mud and Musk Turtles is not advised unless necessary.&nbsp; While they make incredible pets, they can kick, attempt to bite, and scratch a lot when pulled out of the water.&nbsp; Turtles do not understand that we are not giant predators and will often act defensively when they are removed from the water.&nbsp; Although they are great pets and full of life, they are best left in their enclosures.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Be sure to wash your hands after handling any reptiles.</em></strong></p>
