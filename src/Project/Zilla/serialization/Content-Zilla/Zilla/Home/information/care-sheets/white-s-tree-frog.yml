        <h2>A Great Introductory Amphibian</h2>
        <p>White&rsquo;s Tree Frogs are an incredibly docile amphibian that is unafraid of humans and often lives in close contact with people throughout its habitat.  These chubby frogs are also known as Dumpy Tree Frogs because of their pudgy bodies and the large bulges they grow above their heads as adults.  They can range in color from bright green to a beautiful teal blue and sometimes even appear purple.  In captivity, there is a selectively bred line known as a Snowflake which exhibits extreme amounts of white speckling all over its body.  Reluctant to jump, hardy, and large at 4-5&rdquo; as adults, these frogs make a great first amphibian pet for anyone.</p>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>White&rsquo;s Tree Frogs are native to northern and eastern Australia and the island of New Guinea.  These tropical frogs enjoy warm humid climates although they are not usually found in tropical rainforests.  They can be found in tree canopies near bodies of water but have also been found in terrestrial habitats with no water nearby. They prefer old Eucalyptus trees with water filled hollows to hide in.  They are commonly found throughout their distribution area of over 1,574,000 square miles.</p>
        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>Housing must be sealed and escape proof with a secured top or aquarium hood. A perfect terrarium for one adult or two young frogs is the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=319FD0D37E2842F2B3AA50CF6A6903A1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Vertical Tropical Kit</a>.  If you&rsquo;re looking to keep more than 2 juveniles or 2 adults, a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B28406F18AE5444B8BF1DE324F64C9B1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">18x18x5 Zilla Front Opening Terrarium</a>&nbsp;works well. Provide several horizontal perches for the frog to climb and rest on.&nbsp; For both naturalistic and functional d&eacute;cor options, check out the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E6A5BF135A0F425B972F719F30F28E9E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Vertical D&eacute;cor</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E96356264CC64735B4A26B1D20939D3F&amp;_z=z">Zilla Spring Cave</a>. Substrates that retain moisture and humidity should be used such as&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1411D472E7DC42F193D5E36180E5D4E4&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Jungle Mix</a> or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BD127C782384DB58FB72C82A0CCADD0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Coconut Husk Brick</a>.  For additional humidity, use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EA2ABB6F875642FEBFB93FF1CF201018&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Terrarium Moss</a>.  Provide a large, shallow water dish, such as a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C9595BB188204E13900E56B0C9AA33A3&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Terraced Dish</a>, in the enclosure and change the water at least 2-3 times weekly.</p>
        <h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
        <p>Maintain White&rsquo;s Tree Frogs between 60-90% humidity.  This can be accomplished by misting the enclosure at least once daily. Provide a thermal gradient (a warm side and a cool side) with a cool side being 70-75&deg;F and a basking spot of 80-85&deg;F.  The basking temperature can be reached using a&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E779B2BE0D54A41B4036B376AC80C38&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Halogen Mini Dome</a> with a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D3702069ED2146608ED4F6B8EA19DE6E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Day Blue 25W Mini Halogen Bulb</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B120383A61C745518A0C3499E0DC3E0F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Mini Tropical UVB Bulb</a>.  Provide a 12-14 hour light cycle.</p>
        <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
        <p>In the wild, White&rsquo;s Tree Frogs are insectivorous and will eat insects, arachnids and other invertebrates. They will occasionally catch and consume smaller amphibians or even small rodents.  In captivity, they should be fed a diet of crickets, roaches and/or mealworms 2-3 times weekly. Be careful not to overfeed them as obesity and other health concerns will become an issue.  Feeder insects should be given <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AC8DE9141E4F4D4C8FEBA5F45453ED0C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Gut Load Cricket Drink</a>.  By using this product, you will increase the nutritional value of your feeders and help pass important nutrients to your frogs.  When feeding, spray the crickets with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E75CB5008F9F41BBA3BC3A3330176D4E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Calcium Supplement</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6BBB6E4075484EF0BC0BD018BBEBDAB2&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Vitamin Supplement</a>&nbsp;1-2 times weekly for additional calcium which is important to keeping a healthy pet.</p>
        <h2>Handling</h2>
        <p>Unlike many amphibians, White&rsquo;s Tree Frogs will tolerate some level of careful, deliberate handling and can often become fairly accustomed to it . As with all amphibians, their skin is soft and permeable so wash your hands thoroughly and avoid any lotions, creams, or oils before handling them.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Also be sure to wash your hands after handling any reptiles or amphibians.</em></strong></p>
