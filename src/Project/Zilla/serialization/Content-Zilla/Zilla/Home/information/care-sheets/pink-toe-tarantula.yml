        <h2>Small, fast, and beautiful</h2>
        <p>Pink Toe Tarantulas are a group in the genus Avicularia and Caribena.&nbsp; Nearly all these tarantulas exhibit incredible blue, pink, purple, and red coloration, along with their signature pink toes.&nbsp; These beautiful arboreal jewels throughout northern South America and the southern Caribbean.&nbsp; They are a small to mid-sized tarantula that spends nearly all its time off the ground and prefers to build its web in the nooks and crannies of trees.&nbsp; These make a perfect species for beginners due to their more docile nature.&nbsp; They make amazing pets to interact with and observe.&nbsp; Pink toes rarely flick itchy hairs or bite, they are more prone to quickly run away from danger.&nbsp; Their docile nature does not mean they are slow.&nbsp; They are flighty and fast, so make sure when moving around them to make slow and smooth movements as to not scare them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>These vibrant tarantulas have a native range from Costa Rica in Central America down to Brazil in South America and can also be found on southern Caribbean islands.&nbsp; They are a highly tropical species and inhabit trees in these tropical areas.&nbsp; They build their web nests in crevices of trees and between clumped branches or debris.&nbsp; When creating a habitat, remember to give your pink toe plenty of vertical climbing and hiding places.&nbsp; In the wild they are often hiding from predators.</p>
        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>Housing must be sealed and escape proof.&nbsp; For young tarantulas over 1.5&rdquo; the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A45018992564096B0613E5B50F7426E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Arboreal Micro Habitats</a>&nbsp;are an easy, secure, and beautiful way to display these beautiful invertebrates.&nbsp; The Large Arboreal Micro Habitat will make a great home for your adult tarantula, but if you&rsquo;d like to give them more room, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B28406F18AE5444B8BF1DE324F64C9B1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Front Opening Terrariums</a>&nbsp;are another great option.&nbsp; The 12&rdquo;x12&rdquo;x20&rdquo; would be plenty of space for your pet.&nbsp; Humidity is a key to keeping them healthy.&nbsp; Make sure to keep the terrarium humidity between 70-90%.&nbsp; Using tropical substrates, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1411D472E7DC42F193D5E36180E5D4E4&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Jungle Mix</a>, and adding <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EA2ABB6F875642FEBFB93FF1CF201018&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Terrarium Moss</a>&nbsp;on top of it and in crevices throughout the terrarium will help increase the humidity.&nbsp; Make sure to provide plenty of branches that extend to the top of the terrarium and try crossing a few of them to create anchoring areas for the tarantula to build its web.&nbsp; Also, make sure to provide a small water bowl with clean water they can drink from.</p>
        <h2>Temperature and Lighting</h2>
        <p>Within most of this tarantula&rsquo;s habitat range the temperatures are between 60&deg;F and 80&deg;F year-round.&nbsp; This makes them easy to keep at home since they can live at the room temperature of most homes.&nbsp; If you need to add some heat, use an enclosure with a screen top and add a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D3702069ED2146608ED4F6B8EA19DE6E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Day Blue 25w Mini Halogen Bulb</a>&nbsp;in a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=64BB7EE1146844018A4B45C9BFE08E5B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Single Low Profile Fixture</a>.&nbsp; While these tarantulas don&rsquo;t need UVA/UVB to survive, it is highly beneficial to all living things.&nbsp; Add heat and UV lighting using the Zilla Dual Low Profile Fixture with the Zilla Day Blue 25w Mini Halogen Bulb and a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B120383A61C745518A0C3499E0DC3E0F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Tropical Mini UVA/UVB Bulb</a>.</p>
        <h2>Feeding / Diet</h2>
        <p>Wild tarantulas are opportunistic feeders and will prey on a variety of things from other invertebrates to small lizards and frogs.&nbsp; In captivity they eat a variety of invertebrates such as crickets and dubia roaches. Feeder insects should be fed a nutritional gut-load insect food and given <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AC8DE9141E4F4D4C8FEBA5F45453ED0C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Gut Load Cricket Drink</a>. By feeding these products you will increase the nutritional value of your feeders and help pass important nutrients on to the tarantula. When feeding, spray the insects with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E75CB5008F9F41BBA3BC3A3330176D4E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Calcium Supplement</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6BBB6E4075484EF0BC0BD018BBEBDAB2&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zilla Vitamin Supplement</a>&nbsp;1-2 times weekly for additional calcium and vitamin D3, along with other essential nutrients.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Handling</h2>
        <p>Tarantulas can be handled, but it must be done carefully.&nbsp; While this species will tolerate occasional handling, it is easily scared. Even the feeling of your breath can startle it and cause your tarantula to run or jump.&nbsp; This can be catastrophic if the tarantula is held too high in the air and hits the ground.&nbsp; Falling from a height over 3 feet can cause their exoskeleton to rupture and is often fatal.&nbsp; While handling them, allow them to walk on and through your hands.&nbsp; Make sure you are close to the floor while handling and don&rsquo;t handle for more than 5 minutes to prevent stress.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Also be sure to wash your hands after handling any animals.</em></strong></p>
