While it’s not necessary for all reptiles, it is highly recommended and for many it is imperative.&nbsp; Animals such as turtles, tortoises, iguanas, bearded dragons, and chameleons cannot live without access to proper levels of UVB.&nbsp; Without it, they are unable to synthesize vitamin D3 and metabolize the calcium in their diet.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/vitamins-supplements-care/calcium-supplement-spray?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Calcium</span></a> is important for proper bone growth in reptiles, but is also necessary for nervous system function.&nbsp; Without UVB, these animals can become deformed, paralyzed, and will eventually die.&nbsp; UVB and UVA are good for all reptiles.&nbsp; While some species may not need it to survive, many studies show improved immune systems, increased activity, better eating habits, better breeding habits, and a better circadian rhythm, all building up to a healthier and happier pet.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="Zilla temperature and humidity gauge showing desert and tropical temperature and humidity ranges" src="-/media/80189EE6C42244A2925AC94B42F8EFAB.ashx?h=228&amp;w=225&amp;hash=880740703F7F485A98868A4488590B4ADE400DFA&amp;hash=880740703F7F485A98868A4488590B4ADE400DFA" style="height: 228px;

Remember that even in the deserts of the world, these animals are able to find humidity underground or deep in rock crevices.&nbsp; For many species, such as tortoises and bearded dragons, it is helpful to <a href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/vitamins-supplements-care/shed-ease-reptile-bath?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">soak </span></a>them twice a week in luke-warm water (around 84-88°F).&nbsp;

In captivity our options for food are much more limited based on what is commercially available and easy to find.&nbsp; Insectivores often eat multiple species of insects and in captivity,&nbsp;most people feed them crickets and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/food/reptile-munchies/reptile-munchies-mealworm?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mealworms</span></a>.&nbsp; While these foods are easy and more convenient, they do overly simplify the nutritional intake of your pet and it is important to look for other feeder types.&nbsp; Some feeder insects that are becoming more commercially available are dubia roaches, phoenix worms, horned worms, and calciworms.&nbsp; Try supplementing these into your insectivore pet's diet.&nbsp;Carnivores, such as monitor species, may eat rodents, birds, lizards, and other small prey items.&nbsp; Although much of their diet is made up of small rodents, these animals are more opportunistic in the wild and will eat a variety of prey items.&nbsp; Try adding other whole prey items, insects such as dubia roaches and more, as well as additional meats like fish, chicken livers, and eggs.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/food/reptile-munchies/reptile-munchies-vegetable?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Herbivores</span></a>&nbsp;will dine on a wide range of leafy plants, roots, flowers, and grasses, but&nbsp;there is much more available to feed.&nbsp;

Oversimplifying the Environment</strong></h2> <p>While doing research on how to take care of our new pets, we often look to care sheets.&nbsp; The unfortunate thing is that a lot of times these are written with the bare minimum requirements to keep the animal alive and not always how to keep it thriving.&nbsp; This doesn’t mean that you need to recreate a mini rainforest in your terrarium, but you do want to get as close as you can to recreating their habitat.&nbsp; Paying special attention to heat and humidity requirements is essential.&nbsp; Most care sheets will also state that animals such as geckos and snakes don’t need UVB, but studies show that many species still use UVB for metabolizing calcium even if they have more nocturnal habits than some of the more diurnal species.&nbsp; While these animals may not need UVB to survive, they can live a much better and healthier life with access to <a href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/lighting-heating?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UVB and UVA lighting</span></a>.&nbsp;

While this does reduce the risk of impaction, it also removes a large part of their enrichment and natural instincts to burrow and hide during the day.&nbsp; This can cause them more stress in the end, which can weaken their immune system.&nbsp; While trying to create your new pets habitat, research where they come from, what the temperatures are like there year round, how humid it is, what the yearly rainfall is, and where in that habitat they are found.&nbsp; Searching online for scientific publications can give you some awesome insight into how these animals live in the wild.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img height="275" alt="Pancake tortoise in the palm of a person's hand" width="275" src="-/media/32D1BF29404A49EFB7A2B2F76C634C43.ashx?h=275&amp;w=275&amp;hash=35DB9A40EBB3C12BFF16E08F1A522CA1B5F06ACF&amp;hash=35DB9A40EBB3C12BFF16E08F1A522CA1B5F06ACF" style="height: 275px;

With wild caught animals, it is important to get them checked for internal and external parasites.&nbsp; All animals that live in the wild will have these, and potentially other bacterial or viral pathogens just from living in nature.&nbsp; While they are in the wild these parasites may not bother them, but when they are brought into captivity and begin to become stressed, they can gain a foothold and cause issues.&nbsp; This is why it’s important to take them into the vet for a basic checkup.&nbsp; This can help you to treat any possible parasites and get them healthier and ready to thrive in their new home.&nbsp; Even animals that are bred in captivity can have parasites and pathogens.&nbsp; An initial screening from your reptile veterinarian can be very helpful in preventing any possible diseases and parasites from affecting your new pet.&nbsp;
