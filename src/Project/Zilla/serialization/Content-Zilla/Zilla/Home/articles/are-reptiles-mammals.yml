        There are so many types of pets! As you learn more about your favorite cold-blooded buddies, you might start to wonder &mdash; are reptiles mammals? Or, are they their own group of animals? We're so glad you asked!<br />
        <h2>So, are reptiles mammals?</h2>
        No, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=849365B30DD948868E6AC973F7B7EC9B&amp;_z=z">reptiles aren't mammals</a>. They're a category of animals that includes lizards, snakes, alligators, and crocodiles. Our first records of these creatures date back 315 million years to fossils from the Paleozoic era.<br />
        <br />
        Occasionally turtles are also lumped into the reptile labeling, but they are technically in their own class known as Chelonia. And, if you want to get real science-y, birds are sometimes added to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/reptiles/" target="_blank">the reptile category</a> by researchers thanks to their genetic similarities to their scaly cousins and ability to lay eggs.<br />
        <h2>What are reptiles?</h2>
        Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones and breathe air. At a glance, you'll notice reptiles are covered in scales or bony plates (not hair or feathers) that shed regularly. Reptiles aren't able to maintain a constant body temperature internally &mdash; they rely on their environment (hot sun, a cool cave, a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=57937894798449E785355C89E9890B88&amp;_z=z">heat emitter</a>, a log hideout) to help. Most reptiles lay eggs to produce young. A few varieties of snakes, worm lizards, and lizards have live births.<br />
        <br />
        There are over <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/reptiles/" target="_blank">8,200 species of reptiles</a>. Some of the most common ones you might be eyeing at your local pet store or reptile swap event include <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=15F7F03DBCC34E799A6C1CF60684DECC&amp;_z=z">leopard geckos</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9E3137510C304F5680915615413083BB&amp;_z=z">ball pythons</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=80549B3D67F9468BA11A1A9DA39FC328&amp;_z=z">bearded dragons</a>, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B454443273CA4677BC8B4D9C85F89066&amp;_z=z">corn snakes</a>.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Fun fact</strong>: Most of us think of dinosaurs as reptiles. However, new research is discovering that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/most-dinosaurs-were-warm-blooded-after-all-70071" target="_blank">many dinosaurs were actually warm-blooded</a> and closer in structure to birds than reptiles!<br />
        <h2>What are mammals?</h2>
        Mammals are warm-blooded. They also have backbones and breathe air. Unlike reptiles, mammals have skin or fur, not scales. These cozy body coverings and sweat glands (which reptiles don't have!) help them maintain a more constant body temperature.<br />
        <br />
        When it comes to offspring, most mammals have live births. And the adult females have milk-producing mammary glands to feed their young.<br />
        <br />
        There are approximately 5,400 species of mammals identified. You're probably familiar with lots of the common household mammal pets, including cats, dogs, guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Fun fact</strong>: Some scientists hypothesize that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/mammal/Evolution-and-classification" target="_blank">mammals evolved from some classes of prehistoric reptiles</a>.<br />
        <br />
        So, now you know! Reptiles are not mammals. They are a class all their own. Learn more about your favorite lizards, geckos, snakes, tortoises, and turtles in these <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3D8E54DA207B4583B2FDE00F0E507E10&amp;_z=z">handy care sheets</a>.
