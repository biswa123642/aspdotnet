The daily agenda for reptiles and other living things is at least partially dictated by the sun. Sunlight not only helps you feel warm and happy, it also provides necessary vitamins. This holds true for your favorite pets. A bearded dragon, for example, doesn’t have an adorable little clock in the terrarium to keep it on schedule, he or she relies on lighting to help stay on track. Light and heat dictate the circadian rhythm, which helps your pet know when to eat and when to sleep. Without a proper circadian rhythm, your pet will experience increased stress and their body will respond negatively.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> <br> Luckily, this is an easy problem to avoid.

These are both types of ultraviolet (and UV) light. Each type of light has a different role to play in keeping your pet happy and healthy. The UV spectrum is broken up into three parts: UVA, UVB and UVC. All three of these types of light are found in natural sunlight.<br> <br> •<span> </span><strong>UVA</strong> light helps regulate behaviors such as feeding, diurnal movement, mating and similar activities.<br> •<span> </span><strong>UVB</strong> light allows the synthesis of vitamin D3, which helps to absorb calcium.<br> •<span> </span><strong>UVC</strong> light is not required for reptiles, but it can help kill bacteria. It’s important to note that at high levels of exposure this light can be harmful to most animals.<br> <br> UV wavelengths are filtered by glass and plastic, so to get the most out of your bulbs be sure they have direct exposure to the habitat. Over time UV output will diminish. We recommend replacing your fluorescent bulbs every 3,500 hours or around 12 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div unselectable="on" class="rrHandle rrN" style="position: absolute; cursor: n-resize; z-index: auto; height: 7px; width: 7px; top: 788.5px; left: 357px;">&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: lighter;">&nbsp;</span></div> <p>&nbsp;<img alt="spectrograph showing xray, uvc, uvb, uva, and visible light on a chart" src="-/media/F2E35CA59A334871965B01BA7C27ABAD.ashx?h=218&amp;&amp;w=614&amp;hash=C03B194FAE4943B8C7FFFE221CAB8EE7ABE55666&amp;hash=C03B194FAE4943B8C7FFFE221CAB8EE7ABE55666" width="614" height="218">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">How to Choose the Right Lighting/Heat Fixture for Your Terrarium</span></strong><br> <br> There are bulbs that provide heat, bulbs that provide light, and bulbs that provide both.

Over time you can find more ways to improve your terrarium and give your pet a home in which he or she will thrive. Here are a few places to start.<br> <br> 1. What is your pet’s natural habitat?<br> <br> To build the best home for your pet you need to know as much as possible about where they originate. Recreating their natural environment will help them feel comfortable and help them ease into their natural habits. Does your pet originate from a tropical or desert environment? What’s the humidity like? Are there a lot of rocks? Sand? These questions will help you with every aspect of your terrarium, lighting or otherwise.<br> <br> 2.

You want to create a balance in your pet’s home, as too much of anything could be harmful to your reptile or amphibian.<br> <br> 3. Should you factor in a day/night cycle?<br> <br> All animals need a day/night cycle to keep a healthy circadian rhythm. This rhythm keeps sleep cycles and hormone release in check.
