It&rsquo;s important that you create an atmosphere that matches your pet&rsquo;s natural environment as closely as possible, this includes re-creating a day and night cycle.<br /> <br /> Like people, all animals rely on their environment to tell them when it&rsquo;s okay to sleep and when it&rsquo;s okay to be active. Sunlight (or artificial sunlight) plays a major role in influencing an animal&rsquo;s daily schedule, and their circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms are physical and mental changes that dictate behavior following a 24-hour cycle which is greatly affected by light and darkness in an organism&rsquo;s environment. This rhythm influences important bodily functions such as sleep-wake cycles and hormone release which in turn affect your pet&rsquo;s mental state. If your reptile isn&rsquo;t sleeping right, or is off its regular schedule, it may become stressed out and unhappy. In order to best care for your pet you need to create a day and night cycle that matches with their biological clock. <br /> <br /> All diurnal (definition: active during the day) reptiles should have access to UVB (which stands for ultraviolet B) light. Turtles, tortoises, bearded dragons, iguanas, and chameleons are some common examples of reptiles that need UVB light. This helps prevent animals from developing hypocalcemia (or lack of calcium). UVB lights should be kept on during the day and turned off at night and should be used along with calcium supplements. Do not keep UVB lights on all the time as this can cause another problem, hypercalcemia (too much calcium).</p> <p> Do the research for the specific animal that you have, but a good rule of thumb is to program the UVB and daytime light/heat to be on for 12 hours and then turned off for 12 hours. During the 12 hours when bright lights are off, there should still be nighttime heat (black or red bulbs, heat mat, or ceramic heat emitter), this is also a time when the animal can get some rest without bright light distracting them.<br /> <br /> The information below will provide you with steps to take to keep your little friends happy and healthy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Research Your Reptile's Native Environment</span></strong></p> <p>Where does your pet originate? Using bearded dragons as one example, they come from the Australian outback which is a desert environment. Therefore, they would need a certain amount of UVA and UVB radiation from the sun to be healthy. You can provide them with the heat and UVB needed using a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/lighting-heating?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.45.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heat &amp; UVB</span></a> Fixture with a 50W <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/lighting-heating/mini-halogen-bulbs?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.45.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank">Mini Halogen Bulb</a></span> and perhaps a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zillarules.com/all-products/lighting-heating/canopy-series-fluorescent-uvb-uva-reptile-light-bulbs?__hstc=27337699.642f7ce530b508df675442d20425f6b8.1517251866395.1517514186337.1517521791104.11&amp;__hssc=27337699.45.1517521791104&amp;__hsfp=4095774679" target="_blank">Desert Series 50 UVB</a></span> Bulb, depending on the fixture type.
