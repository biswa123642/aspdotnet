        <p><span>A horse’s natural environment is outside in lush green pastures with room to explore, hanging out and interacting with other members of their herd.&nbsp; Due to geographic location, barn set-up, injury or severe weather, any sort of lengthy pasture time may not be an option.&nbsp; When horses are restricted in box stalls or smaller turnouts, they can become bored, grumpy and sometimes even destructive!&nbsp;<br> </span></p><br /><image src="~/media/0BD9AC8A749844F0A61194BC302907F6.ashx" ></image><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Horses need to be mentally and physically stimulated to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle. &nbsp;Horses today spend much of their time alone indoors or in small paddocks with just one or two companions. &nbsp;With enough exercise and time spent with human companions, this may be enough mental and physical stimulation for some horses. &nbsp;Other horses; however, especially young ones, require extra stimulation to fight off boredom. &nbsp;Many unhealthy activities and stable vices, such as cribbing or wood chewing, can develop as a symptom of boredom. &nbsp;To help your horses combat boredom, you can try providing them with toys.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Finding the perfect toy for your horse may take some trial and error, but luckily, you can never have too many.&nbsp; The right toy will be mentally stimulating, physically engaging and most importantly, safe.</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/FD98F1D003CC453BA095290E268C910B.ashx" /><h3 rs_id="852">Outdoor Toys</h3> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Outdoor toys can often be things you already have around your barn that can be safely chased, kicked, pushed, tossed around or picked up and carried by your horse. &nbsp;Things like rubber food tubs, buckets, large traffic cones, and plastic (not metal) barrels are great toys for outdoor areas. &nbsp;If you give your horse a plastic barrel to play with, be sure that both ends are firmly closed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>You can also purchase toys specifically made for equine use, like a durable, horse-sized ball that he can chase and bite at. &nbsp;Rubber balls with handles are fun to fling around the pasture, and your horse will delight in the unpredictable bounce and motion.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span><br> </span></p> <h3 rs_id="852">Indoor Toys</h3> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">For a horse who spends a lot of time in a box stall, especially a horse who is recovering from an injury and requiring stall rest, there are plenty of simple toy options. &nbsp;A ball on a rope (similar to a tetherball) is fun for horses to push and swing around their stall. &nbsp;Be sure that the ball is hung high, around wither-height, so your horse won’t get a leg caught in the rope.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">An empty plastic gallon milk jug attached to a rope and hung in the stall makes for an exciting and inexpensive swinging toy for your horse. &nbsp;It’s fun for your horse to twirl or bash around and make noise with. &nbsp;You can even cut holes in the sides of the jug and put carrots inside for extra fun!</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Some horses enjoy playing with stuffed animals. &nbsp;You can often find large, slightly used stuffed animals at garage sales for very cheap. &nbsp;They’re fun for your horse to shake or toss around, and being soft, they won’t hurt him or things in his environment.</p><br /><image src="~/media/FBFEA79EEB3643F0B611DC57A470C292.ashx" /><h3 rs_id="852">Treat-Dispensing Toys</h3> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>Toys that dispense food and treats force your horse to work for his dinner. &nbsp;Figuring out how to get his favorite food out of his favorite toy will be mentally stimulating, physically engaging and delicious!&nbsp; There are several treat-dispensing toys on the market that you can try. &nbsp;Some are hexagonal-type balls that can be moved and kicked every which way, and others are more elongated that only roll back-and-forth.&nbsp; When your horse rolls or shoves it, the grain or treats will dribble out of the <span style="white-space: pre;">								   </span>hole for him.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>Be careful with treat-dispensing toys if your horse is on sandy soil or tends to accidentally eat the bedding from his stall, as both can cause digestive disturbances. &nbsp;Also, remember that an overweight or insulin-resistant horse doesn’t need the extra calories from a treat-dispensing toy.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span><br> </span></p> <h3 rs_id="852">Other Ways to Fight Boredom</h3> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>There are plenty of ways to fight boredom other than with traditional toys. &nbsp;For example, many horses enjoy a frozen popsicle treat in warm weather. &nbsp;Freeze water flavored with apple juice or peppermint candies in a plastic bowl, then empty it into your horse’s feed bucket. He will love chewing and licking this refreshing treat on a hot day. &nbsp;You can also put chunks of apples or carrots in his water bucket so he can bob for treats!</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>Many horses also enjoy listening to music. &nbsp;Play a variety of music for your horse, paying attention to what music he seems to like best. &nbsp;Then, make him a playlist of his favorite tunes to brighten up his day.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>A variety of toys and activities will do wonders for your horse’s physical and emotional health. &nbsp;Consider purchasing or making a toy for your horse. &nbsp;He will enjoy the stimulation and you will enjoy watching him frolic and play!</span></p>
