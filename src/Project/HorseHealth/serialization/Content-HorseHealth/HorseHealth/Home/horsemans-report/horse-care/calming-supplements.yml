        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Horses are unique individuals that handle situations differently.&nbsp; While one horse may be calm as a cucumber and show no care in the world, another might have a very high &ldquo;flight&rdquo; response and become nervous at the slightest thing.&nbsp; Although some horses can be more &ldquo;high-strung&rdquo; by nature, there are some things that horse owners can do to help ease the situation and help their horse become more rideable.</span></p>

        <h3 rs_id="852">Understanding Your Horse</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s important to understand when your horse becomes nervous in order to address the behavior.&nbsp; Does he get excited only when he&rsquo;s left alone or at an unfamiliar place?&nbsp; Or does he spook on a regular basis when you ride, even in familiar surroundings?&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s regularly a tense and excitable horse, that might just be his personality.&nbsp; Many people often think of Arabians or Thoroughbreds for that type of behavior, but any breed of horse may be super alert, spooky or skittish.&nbsp; Age and gender may also affect your horse&rsquo;s behavior; younger horses tend to be more hyper than mature horses.&nbsp; Many mares have hormonal swings during the spring that can make them difficult to ride.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Feed Management</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Diet can directly impact your horse&rsquo;s energy and state of mind.&nbsp; Foods with high sugar and starch levels, such as concentrates, can rile up even the calmest equines.&nbsp; Put your horse on a diet with more fiber-enriched foods, like roughage, to help mellow him out.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Overfeeding your horse compared to his activity level can also create an energetic horse.&nbsp; If you feed your horse a performance grain, but he only gets ridden 3 times a week with minimal turnout, he may be receiving too many calories with a lack of adequate means of expelling his energy.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Stable Management</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Examine your horse&rsquo;s living arrangements.&nbsp; If you have a young, high-energy equine who spends much of his time in a box stall, this may not be conducive to his behavior.&nbsp; Young horses need to spend time outside where they can burn off pent-up energy.&nbsp; Adding a steady stable buddy can also help take the edge off.&nbsp; Stable buddies can be any calm animal; many race horses travel with companions like goats, dogs or chickens.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Health Checks</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Medical and behavioral problems can contribute to a horse&rsquo;s skittishness as well.&nbsp; A vision problem can make him hesitant about going from a light area to a dark one and can cause him to jump when something flashy catches his eye.&nbsp; A horse with back problems may get tense or jumpy when being tacked up or ridden.&nbsp; If your horse has had a bad experience in a trailer or indoor arena, those places may make him panic.&nbsp; Veterinary visits or farrier care may also be stress triggers.&nbsp; Being aware of when, where and how your horse acts up will help you determine the root cause.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <h3 rs_id="852">Calming Supplements</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Depending on the reason behind your horse&rsquo;s spookiness, calming supplements may provide some relief and make your horse easier to manage.&nbsp; If there is a stressful event on the horizon for your horse, test a calming supplement on him before the day of the event.&nbsp; Different calming supplements can work very well on some horses, but not on others.&nbsp; If you will be participating in a show or competition, make sure to check the association rules and regulations to see if there are any restrictions against the ingredients used in the calming supplements.&nbsp; Some equine organizations ban substances that include popular ingredients found in calming supplements.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>How Do Calming Supplements Work?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Serotonin is a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormone and neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system that creates feelings of relaxation and contentment.&nbsp; The body requires an essential amino acid called L-tryptophan to form serotonin.&nbsp; L-tryptophan is found in grass and pasture, although it may not be present in large amounts.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Giving your horse a calming supplement with tryptophan, like </span><a href="https://www.horsehealthproducts.com/all-products/b-kalm"><span>B-Kalm&trade; Calming &amp; Focusing Paste</span></a><span>, will not provide him with an immediate boost of serotonin; rather the effects will likely take place within 1.5 &ndash; 2 hours and last for about 8 hours.&nbsp; Since tryptophan is found in the horse&rsquo;s body, it can be used daily to help your horse overcome a traumatic experience or ease his show nerves.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Minerals like magnesium and calcium, and vitamins such as vitamin B1 (thiamine), may also be included in calming supplements, but their effectiveness has mainly been proven anecdotally.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to note that feeding excess magnesium and calcium could have adverse effects on the growth of young horses, so it&rsquo;s always best to consult your veterinarian before adding these types of supplements to your young horse&rsquo;s diet.&nbsp; Other ingredients that can be found in calming supplements include chamomile, valerian, inositol and taurine.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Evaluate your excitable horse to better understand when and where he becomes nervous. &nbsp;He may need a change in diet, a better exercise schedule or more time outdoors in order to release some of his excess energy. &nbsp;If you feel a calming supplement may help your horse, a tryptophan-based supplement is a good place to start.</span></p>
