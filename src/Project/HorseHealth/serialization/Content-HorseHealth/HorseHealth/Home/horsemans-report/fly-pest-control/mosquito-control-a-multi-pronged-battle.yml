        <p>Mosquitoes can be enormous pests to our horses, but even worse, they may spread diseases [disease-causing pathogens] like West Nile virus or Eastern and Western equine encephalitis (EEE and WEE).  As horse owners, our goal is to minimize our horses&rsquo; exposure to mosquitoes and their risk of being bit.  This can sometimes feel like a losing battle, but attacking these insects on multiple fronts can make a big difference in your horse&rsquo;s well-being. </p>
        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>Reduce Mosquito Populations</h2>
        <p>As the famous phrase says, &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,&rdquo; and the best place to start eliminating exposure to mosquitoes is around the barn.</p>
        <br />

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Eliminate Potential Mosquito Breeding Areas</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>A good way to control mosquitoes is to eliminate the larval development sites on your property.&nbsp; Mosquitoes require stagnant water for larval development, so addressing areas with slowly moving or stagnant water is a good place to start.&nbsp; If you have a pond on your property, adding a fountain or filter will help keep the water moving, or consider introducing koi fish to stir the water and eat the mosquito larvae.&nbsp; Some local mosquito control programs will provide fish for free or at a low cost, so be sure to check with your local cooperative extension.&nbsp; You can also greatly cut back on mosquito larvae by dumping out water tubs and buckets at least every 3 days, discarding any old tires or other junk that might be holding water, and positioning your drainage system to ensure water isn&rsquo;t collecting anywhere.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Plant Repellent Shrubbery</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>While plants won&rsquo;t kill mosquitoes or mosquito larvae, they may help repel them by releasing odorous oils.&nbsp; Some plants, like marigolds, basil and lavender have odors that help keep mosquitoes away.&nbsp; Plant them in window boxes or planters near your barn and doorways to keep mosquito traffic to a minimum. </span></p>
        <br />

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Utilize Screens and Fans</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Screens and fans can aid in mosquito control by blocking or blowing mosquitoes from the barn. &nbsp;While screens may not be practical for many barn set-ups, fans can be strategically placed in aisle ways or on stalls to help airflow and blow bugs away.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Use Biological and Chemical Controls</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Another way to combat your mosquito population is through the use of larvicides.&nbsp; Areas of standing water can be treated with products containing a bacterium called <em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis </em>(Bti) or S-methoprene (an insect growth regulator), like </span><a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/products/rural-retail/pre-strike-mosquito-torpedo"><span>Pre-Strike&reg; Mosquito Torpedo&reg;</span></a><span> </span><span style="color: windowtext;">larvicide tablets</span><span>, which attack and kill mosquito larvae.&nbsp; <em>Bti</em> and S-methoprene won&rsquo;t harm humans, animals, fish or vegetation when used as directed.&nbsp; You can find these products at your local home &amp; garden stores in various forms.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Many towns will spray mosquito adulticides in the late summer if cases of EEE or West Nile virus begin showing up.&nbsp; Unfortunately, horses are sentinel animals, meaning they are typically the warning sign to the community that West Nile or EEE is present; therefore, towns don&rsquo;t typically take action until <em>after</em> a horse has contracted the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span><br />
        </span></p>
        <h2>Minimize your Horse's Exposure</h2>
        <p>In addition to the environmental aspect of mosquito control, it&rsquo;s also important to minimize your horse&rsquo;s contact with mosquitoes. &nbsp;Keeping your horse inside during dawn and dusk hours when mosquitoes are most active can be helpful in preventing contact.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong>Repellent Sprays</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span></span></strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Utilizing insect repellents&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">on your horse is also a very effective way to reduce exposure to mosquitoes. </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;"></span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">A study from the University of Tennessee shows some of the most effective repellent chemicals are pyrethrins and pyrethroids, such as permethrin.</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Pyrethroids are synthetic variants that mimic the natural insecticidal properties of plant chemicals and can be combined with a synergist like piperonyl butoxide (PBO).</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">PBO prevents flies and mosquitoes from detoxifying the pyrethrins and pyrethroids (which keeps knocked-down mosquitoes from later recovering), thus increasing their effectiveness. </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;"></span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;"><br />
        </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Choose a repellent spray that best suits your horse&rsquo;s daily routine. &nbsp;If you wash your horse after daily workouts, it may not be advantageous to your pocketbook to use a long-lasting spray, as you will be washing it off every day. &nbsp;If your horse is in daily turnout or lives in a pasture, you may want to opt for a product that includes a coat conditioner or sunscreen to protect the coat and skin, or an equine spot-on that provides up to 14-days protection.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Fly Clothing</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Fly masks, fly sheets and fly wraps are also effective barriers to keep flies and mosquitoes away from horses.&nbsp; There are several different types of masks &ndash; ear protection, nose protection or sun protection &ndash; to choose from, so choose the mask that best fits your horse&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp; Be aware that some of these products may use chemical repellents to deter pests.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><strong><span>Natural Feed Additives</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span>Some horse owners have also had luck repelling insects by adding natural ingredients to their horse&rsquo;s diet, such as garlic and apple cider vinegar, claiming that they make your horse less attractive to bugs, including mosquitoes. &nbsp;Note that most of these products are not under any regulation, so it is a case of buyer beware to some extent.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in;"><span><br />
        </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It is virtually impossible to keep your horse completely mosquito-free during the warm weather, but with some forethought, planning and actions to prevent and repel them, you can keep your local mosquito population to a minimum. &nbsp;</span></p>
