        <p>With summer upon us, you&rsquo;re likely in the middle of the war on flies around your barn.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whether they are looking for a bloodmeal or just to be an annoyance, these persistent insects always seem to manage to find your horse.<span>&nbsp; </span>When developing a plan to manage these pesky critters, it&rsquo;s important to know what species you&rsquo;re battling.<span>&nbsp; </span>Behavior and breeding sites are specific to each fly species, and control tactics should be focused on the specific pest at your facility.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>House flies</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Musca domestica</em>) are usually the most common flies around a stable, and the toughest to repel.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are often found feeding on facial secretions, wet feed and manure. They&rsquo;re also found around sheaths of horses and can be very annoying in high numbers. <span></span>They have sucking-type mouthparts that can feed on both liquids and solid foodstuffs and are most active during the day.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the solid foodstuffs, the house fly vomits on it and its saliva and digestive fluids liquefy the particles, so that it can be sucked up during feeding.<span>&nbsp; </span>This behavior has implicated the house fly in the transmission of several pathogens to both humans and animals, alike.<span>&nbsp; </span>Female house flies lay eggs and the larvae can develop in a variety of places, including decaying organic matter, manure, carrion, garbage, etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>Control measures for the house fly include proper manure management, the elimination of larval breeding sites, and the use of multiple fly control products such as feed-thrus, on-animal sprays, scatter baits, and non-insecticidal traps.</p>

        <p><strong>Face flies</strong> (<em>Musca autumnalis</em>) are closely related to house flies and very difficult to distinguish from one another in the field.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are a non-biting fly that feeds on facial secretions of animals and are responsible for the transmission of pathogens such as pinkeye in cattle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Adult female face flies are typically found around the horse&rsquo;s eyes, mouth and muzzle, causing immense annoyance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The females lay eggs exclusively in fresh cow manure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their larvae will not develop in horse manure, but it&rsquo;s important to note that face flies can travel up to several miles.<span>&nbsp; </span>Control tactics include fly masks and on-animal fly sprays that can be applied to the face and head to kill or repel face flies coming to horses for a food source.<span></span></p>

        <p><span><strong>Stable flies</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Stomoxys calcitrans</em>) are blood-feeding flies that are often found feeding on the legs of horses.&nbsp; They have piercing, sucking-type mouthparts that inflict a rather painful bite and are responsible for pathogen transmission of causative agents of equine infectious anemia and anaplasmosis. Stable flies are responsible for&nbsp;</span>your horse&rsquo;s kicking and stomping, which happens when he&rsquo;s being fed upon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eggs are laid in decaying organic matter, like wet straw or spilled feed, and aged manure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Control measures for stable flies include proper manure management and elimination of decaying organic material.<span>&nbsp; </span>Frequent mowing around barns can minimize resting areas that stable flies use to digest blood meals between feedings.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, care should be taken not to leave piles of grass clippings; when they start to decompose, they turn into a prime larval development habitat.<span>&nbsp; </span>On-animal fly sprays can be used for repellency (be sure to spray the horse&rsquo;s legs and belly well!) and residual premise sprays can be applied to shady sides of barns where stable flies may rest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Feed-thru products are also effective against stable flies by preventing their development into mature adults in the manure of treated horses.</p>

        <p><strong>Horse and deer flies</strong> are all grouped into the family Tabanidae.<span>&nbsp; </span>Horse and deer flies are easily identified by their larger size and the fact that all species in this family have large eyes which they use to locate hosts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Females are daytime blood feeders; they have knifelike mouthparts, inflicting an extremely painful bite and leaving bloody feeding sites on a horse.<span>&nbsp; </span>Males mostly feed on pollen or nectar for an energy source.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eggs are laid on vegetation around water and larvae are often aquatic or semiaquatic.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because horse and deer flies only land on horses for a brief time to feed, they can be difficult to control.<span>&nbsp; </span>On-animal fly sprays can be somewhat effective for repelling and killing horse and deer flies, but reapplication is frequently needed.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are many commercially available traps that can trap horse and deer flies to aid in reducing a population; however, complete elimination of a population is difficult.</p>

        <p style="margin-right: -6.3pt;"><strong>Horn flies</strong> (<em>Haematobia irritans</em>) are small flies that are primarily a pest of pastured cattle, but are also found around horses, sheep and goats.<span>&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;ll find horn flies on the backs, shoulders and sides of the animal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both male and female horn flies have piercing mouthparts and feed on blood, taking up to 40 bloodmeals per day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Due to this feeding behavior they remain on the host animal day and night, leaving only to avoid fly-fighting behaviors by the animal or to lay eggs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eggs are laid in fresh, undisturbed cattle manure where larvae will develop into the next generation of adults.<span>&nbsp; </span>When adults emerge, they seek a host, and often find horses or other non-bovine species to feed upon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Horn flies will not be able to maintain a population by laying eggs in horse manure; however, horn flies readily blood-feed from horses.<span>&nbsp; </span>Horn flies can be controlled by using insecticidal sprays that are labeled for horses.<span>&nbsp; </span>To be most effective, horn fly management practices must be employed in neighboring cattle herds as well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Mosquitoes</strong> are small insects with long, thin bodies and a long, sharp sucking mouthpart.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like the horse and deer fly, the females are blood feeders and the males feed on nectar or pollen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Depending on the species, female mosquitoes will lay eggs on the surface of standing water or in areas that are prone to flooding.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are certain species that prefer &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; water, such as water troughs, while others thrive in stagnant water that is more &ldquo;polluted.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>There are some coastal species that even prefer brackish or saltwater. <span></span>Mosquitoes are a concern for horse owners as they are vectors of eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.<span>&nbsp; </span>Efforts should be made to eliminate all standing water around barns that mosquitoes can use to lay eggs in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Horse waterers should be dumped and cleaned out every few days to interrupt larval mosquito development.<span>&nbsp; </span>On-animal fly sprays can be used to repel and kill adults feeding on horses in pastures, while insecticide barn misting systems can be effective in protecting horses inside. <span></span>There are also various insect growth regulators and biological control products that can be placed in standing water to <span>attack and kill mosquito larvae</span>.<span></span></p>

        <p><strong>Biting midges</strong> (family: Ceratapagonidae), often referred to as sand flies, punkies or no-see-ums, comprise a group of small blood-feeding flies that can be present in populations of thousands per animal.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are found most actively feeding at the hours around dawn and dusk.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eggs are laid in moist areas around ponds, marshes or stock tanks, as the larvae are semi-aquatic and will develop in the muddy areas.<span>&nbsp; </span>In horses, the biting midge (Culicoides genus) has been known to cause &ldquo;sweet itch,&rdquo; a hypersensitivity to the saliva in the insect bite, which is a type of chronic and seasonal skin irritation. <span></span>Control measures for biting midges are limited to on-animal fly products to kill or repel them from feeding and eliminating breeding habitats where possible.</p>
        <p>When adult flies of any species are present, there are likely tens of thousands in their immature stages developing into the next generation.<span>&nbsp; </span>When planning a control program, there is no silver bullet.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is important to incorporate an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program that includes sanitation, population monitoring, biological, and chemical control methods.<span>&nbsp; </span>As always be sure to read and follow label instructions carefully when using any pesticide.</p>
