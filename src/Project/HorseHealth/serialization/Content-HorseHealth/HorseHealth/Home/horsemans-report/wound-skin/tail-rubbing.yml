        <p>Most horse owners dream of having a horse with a long, thick, shiny mane and tail, and go to great lengths to make it look beautiful.&nbsp; So, when you walk out to the barn to find your horse&rsquo;s tail tattered and worn from rubbing, you immediately try to determine why he did this and how you can stop him from doing it again.&nbsp; </p>

        <h3>Reasons for Tail Rubbing&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>There are several different reasons why your horse may be rubbing his tail, but it&rsquo;s best to start by answering a few questions.&nbsp; Is this the first time he&rsquo;s done it, or does he rub his tail often?&nbsp; Does he only rub his tail during certain times of the year or is it a year-round occurrence? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to determine which of the following causes of tail rubbing are at work, so you can take the proper steps to prevent it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Boredom</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Although boredom is a minor cause of tail rubbing, it can be a result of stall confinement and become more of a habit, which can be tricky to counteract.&nbsp; Some horses seem to simply enjoy rubbing their rump along a fence line or hay rack.&nbsp; Tail rubbing is not as common of a habit as cribbing, but it may fit on the same spectrum of behavior issues.&nbsp; If you suspect your horse is bored, you can try giving him more time outside of the stall to run and explore, a friendly companion in the paddock to play with, or offer him a <a href="https://horsehealthproducts.com/horsemans-report/horse-care/boredom-breakers">horse toy</a> to provide mental stimulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Dirty Sheath or Udder</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Geldings and mares will commonly rub their tails if their sheaths or udders needs to be cleaned.&nbsp; All horses produce smegma, a thick, black substance that&rsquo;s made up of dead skin cells and natural oils mixed with dirt and dust from the horse&rsquo;s environment, that accumulates between the folds of the horse&rsquo;s genitalia.&nbsp; When enough smegma builds-up, it can begin to irritate the horse.&nbsp; Since horses cannot reach their sheaths or udders to scratch, they tend to rub their tails instead.&nbsp; To remedy the situation, thoroughly clean your horse&rsquo;s sheath or udder.&nbsp; If your horse won&rsquo;t allow you to clean it, have your veterinarian sedate your horse before cleaning.&nbsp; Some horses naturally produce more smegma than others, so make sure to check the genitalia regularly for build-up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to note that this behavior is not common in active breeding stallions since they are regularly cleaned before breeding.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Dry, Itchy Skin</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Check to see if your horse&rsquo;s skin is dry or flaky.&nbsp; A horse that has dry or flaky skin can become very itchy and begin rubbing his tail to &ldquo;scratch the sweet spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many horse owners often want to bathe their horses to remove the dander and help soothe the skin; however, the use of shampoo can sometimes exacerbate the situation.&nbsp; When bathing your horse, make sure to use a gentle, moisturizing shampoo like the </span><a href="https://www.horsehealthproducts.com/all-products/2-in-1-shampoo-and-conditioner"><span>Horse Health&trade; 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</span></a><span>, and rinse off thoroughly until water runs clear.&nbsp; Flaky skin may also be a result of hot, dry weather.&nbsp; Horses that get dry skin and dull coats in the summertime may benefit from additional omega 3 &amp; 6 fatty acids in their diet.&nbsp; Consider supplementing your horse with a product high in omega 3 &amp; 6 fatty acids.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Insect Hypersensitivity</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>If your horse&rsquo;s tail rubbing primarily occurs in the spring and summer, the underlying cause may be from </span><a href="https://www.horsehealthproducts.com/horsemans-report/fly-pest-control/fly-identification"><span>Culicoides midge</span></a><span> bites. In horses, the biting midge (Culicoides genus) have been known to cause &ldquo;sweet itch,&rdquo; a hypersensitivity to the saliva in the insect bite, which is a type of chronic and seasonal skin irritation.&nbsp; Horses with sweet itch will often rub their tails bald, since the act of scratching the area only worsens the itch.&nbsp; These tiny, irritating flies are also known as sand flies, punkies and no-see-ums.&nbsp; They are mainly present during dawn or dusk, so make sure to either keep your horse inside the barn during this time, apply a fly repellent spray, or use fly masks and sheets to create a physical barrier.&nbsp; Since these insects are poor fliers, you might also want to put fans in your horse&rsquo;s stall to deter them from getting near your horse.</span></p>
        <a href="https://www.horsehealthproducts.com/horsemans-report/fly-pest-control/fly-identification"> </a>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Ticks</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Although they&rsquo;re a less-common cause, ticks can cause irritation and rubbing if they attach to your horse&rsquo;s tail head, tailbone or surrounding areas. &nbsp;On-animal repellent sprays that are labeled for ticks&nbsp;<span>can help keep ticks away from your horse. </span><a href="https://www.horsehealthproducts.com/horsemans-report/fly-pest-control/ticks-bite-how-to-protect-your-horse-against-ticks"><span>Managing your barn environment</span></a><span> will also help to eliminate ticks.&nbsp; Regularly mowing the overgrown grassy areas around your paddocks and barns will help to minimize tick populations and discourage other wildlife that carry ticks from entering your property.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Pinworms</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Internal parasites can also be a cause of tail rubbing.&nbsp; The most common parasite tied to tail rubbing is the pinworm (<em>Oxyuris equi</em>), which causes rectal irritation.&nbsp; Pinworms are mostly seen in younger horses under the age of two but can be found in adult horses as well.&nbsp; Pregnant pinworms migrate through the intestines to lay their eggs around the anus, using a sticky biofilm to hold the eggs in place.&nbsp; You may notice white or dirty yellow crusts around your horse&rsquo;s rectum when pinworms lay eggs.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>The eggs become infective after about 3-5 days and will fall off the horse&rsquo;s rectum, landing in the pasture or stall.&nbsp; Horses can also deposit pinworm eggs when they rub against items such as fencing, feeders or water troughs to scratch their bottom.&nbsp; A horse becomes infected when he accidentally ingests the larvae while grazing or eating the hay in his stall &ndash; and even by rubbing his face on an infected horse&rsquo;s rear end.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Since eggs are not passed through manure, a fecal examination will not reveal the presence of pinworms.&nbsp; If you believe your horse may have pinworms, contact your veterinarian and have him examined.&nbsp; Your vet will most likely take a piece of clear tape and dab it around your horse&rsquo;s anal area in hopes of picking up any eggs still attached there and look at it under a microscope.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>If your horse has pinworms, talk with your veterinarian about a deworming program.&nbsp; An ivermectin-based dewormer, like </span><a href="https://horsehealthproducts.com/all-products/horse-health-ivermectin-paste-187"><span>Horse Health&trade; (ivermectin paste) 1.87%</span></a><span>, is one active that is commonly used to treat pinworms.&nbsp; If ivermectin does not stop the rubbing, or if more eggs are found on your horse post-treatment, a follow-up deworming treatment may be required.&nbsp; This can include a double dose of pyrantel pamoate, which is also the dose commonly used for tapeworms. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>As you can see, there are many reasons why your horse could be rubbing his tail.&nbsp; In order to get to the root cause of the tail rubbing, you may need to do some detective work and a little trial-and-error.&nbsp; When in doubt, seek help and consult your veterinarian.&nbsp; Once the reason has been identified, you can create a plan of action and get your horse&rsquo;s tail looking full and shiny in no time!&nbsp;</span></p>
