        <br /><image src="~/media/C730251567984C30AB080A045AE8AFDF.ashx" /><p style="margin-right: 0.1in;"><span>When you&rsquo;re picking your horse&rsquo;s stall, the composition of his manure is probably the last thing on your mind.&nbsp; Nevertheless, analyzing your horse&rsquo;s manure can reveal important information and is one of the best ways to monitor your horse&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-right: 0.1in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-right: 0.1in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-right: 0.1in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <h3></h3> <h3>What Should I Look for In My Horse&rsquo;s Manure?</h3> <p><span>You can often pick up on any health changes in your horse from the way that his manure looks.&nbsp; When assessing his manure, be sure to look at these five areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Quantity</span></strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Your horse&rsquo;s manure output depends on his diet, how digestible his food is and other health factors like his dental condition. &nbsp;According to researchers at Rutgers University, the average horse produces 35 to 50 pounds of manure per day.<sup> *</sup> &nbsp;Over the course of a year, this can add up to about 9 tons of manure! &nbsp;Miniature horses will produce less manure, while some large draft horses will produce more.</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/BBD18F4D6EA54E649A93C4EBBE671B3B.ashx" /><p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>The average horse passes manure anywhere from 4 to 12+ times a day. &nbsp;Stallions and foals often defecate more frequently than mares and geldings; stallions often &ldquo;scent mark&rdquo; their territory, and foals need to pass more waste because of their liquid diet.</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Horses with a diet that includes high-fiber foods, such as pasture and hay, will have lower digestibility which leads to more manure. &nbsp;Even though horses efficiently handle fiber through their gut bacteria and cecum, they can&rsquo;t digest all the fibers they eat. &nbsp;Diets high in concentrates (i.e., grains) are more easily digestible, but can lead to other health concerns. &nbsp;Horses need a substantial amount of fiber to support proper gut health.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in -19.8pt 10pt 0.25in;"><span>It&rsquo;s important to know how many times per day your horse defecates.&nbsp; Decreased or absent manure can be a serious issue and warrants a call to your veterinarian.&nbsp; This is often a sign of an obstruction, partial obstruction or impaction somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract and could result in death if left untreated.&nbsp; Impactions can result from environmental factors such as sand or dirt intake.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in -0.15in 10pt 0.25in;"><span>However, not all decreased manure production is the result of a serious complication.&nbsp; If you notice your horse has decreased manure production, check with the barn manager to make sure he&rsquo;s being fed the appropriate amount and whether he seems to be finishing all his food, or when his stall was last cleaned.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s not eating with his normal gusto, check his vital signs, listen for gut sounds and call your veterinarian immediately if anything is out of the ordinary.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in -0.15in 10pt 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/9A11137783A849D9B5580D8B801366DC.ashx" /><p style="margin: 0in -0.15in 10pt 0.25in;"><strong>Color</strong></p> <p style="margin: 0in -0.15in 10pt 0.25in;">Since diet affects the color of a horse&rsquo;s manure, you can expect it to be anywhere between green, brown or black. &nbsp;A horse that eats more dried grass will have browner manure, eating lots of alfalfa can produce a greenish tint, and adding in beet pulp may give the manure a reddish tinge.&nbsp; Be on the lookout for a few concerns like if the manure has a blood-red hue or a mucous coating that makes the manure look slimy or gray (may be the result of a slow transit time through the gut).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to know the normal color of your horse&rsquo;s manure and note when any changes take place. &nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Odor</strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Horses rely on bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract to help digest much of the forage and fiber they eat.&nbsp; Horses with intestinal conditions that alter the bacteria in the gut, ulcers or have a sudden change in diet will have unusually foul-smelling manure.&nbsp; If his manure smells like rotten meat, his diet may have too much protein; however, if it smells rancid, it may indicate that he&rsquo;s receiving an excess of carbohydrates.&nbsp; Depending on the severity of the digestive upset, you may also see a change in color and consistency along with the rank odor.&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Consistency</strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Healthy manure should have a glossy shine, indicating normal hydration, and forms neat, somewhat firm, balls. &nbsp;You should be able to break up the manure balls easily.&nbsp; If your horse&rsquo;s manure is dull, dry or hard, he may be dehydrated, and you will need to increase his fluid intake immediately. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the case, you can try soaking hay, pellets or cubes in water or provide him with a soggy bran mash.&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;">The material that makes up the manure should be broken down with no identifiable pieces of hay or other feedstuffs.&nbsp; The presence of stems or intact grains in the manure can indicate that your horse may not be chewing properly. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to call your veterinarian or equine dentist to have his teeth checked; he may need&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">a thorough exam and floating.</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/48B1BFBC8D0F400FB74429382793F45A.ashx" /><p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>If your horse’s manure doesn’t form neat balls, it may indicate a more serious health issue. &nbsp;Piles of soft or liquid manure could also be the result of stress, such as after a hard work out. &nbsp;&nbsp;If your horse has soft or loose manure, take his temperature. &nbsp;If he has a fever, contact your veterinarian.&nbsp; Think about what you’ve fed your horse over the last day or two; a change in diet could lead to misshapen manure. &nbsp;Giving your horse certain medications, such as an antibiotic, can also upset his intestinal flora. &nbsp;Check to see if any other horses in the barn are showing signs of diarrhea.&nbsp; You can also have your veterinarian analyze a sample of the diarrhea-type manure, so she can evaluate for parasites and microscopic evidence of blood.&nbsp; Bacterial infections, such as Salmonella and Clostridial bacteria, can be contagious to other horses, so be sure to practice good hygiene if your horse has diarrhea!</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Foals have immature immune systems and can dehydrate easily, so if your foal develops diarrhea, contact your veterinarian right away. &nbsp;However, there is one exception to the rule:&nbsp; most foals will have loose manure 7 to 10 days post-birth, and again at 30 days, when their dams go through a heat cycle. &nbsp;Known as foal heat scours, this diarrhea occurs as the foal’s gastrointestinal tract switches over to normal bacterial flora. &nbsp;These foals will not show signs of fever or other illnesses, although they may eat manure (coprophagy) to help them populate their gut with bacteria. &nbsp;This is a transient condition that only lasts a couple of days.</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span>Worms</span></strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>When looking at your horse’s manure piles, check closely to see if you detect any worms.&nbsp; If you notice parasites, your horse probably needs to be dewormed.&nbsp; You may also notice parasites a day or two after your horse has been dewormed due to purging; this is normal.&nbsp; However, if your horse hasn’t been dewormed recently and you discover worms, contact your veterinarian immediately to have her analyze a sample of the manure and discuss an appropriate deworming plan.</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>These five factors are important indicators of your horse’s health.&nbsp; Keeping tabs on his manure production and noting any changes in his droppings will help you to catch any potential health issues early on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>RESOURCES:</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><sup style="font-weight: lighter;">*</sup><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Westendorf, Michael and Krogmann, Uta. &ldquo;Horses and Manure.&rdquo;
