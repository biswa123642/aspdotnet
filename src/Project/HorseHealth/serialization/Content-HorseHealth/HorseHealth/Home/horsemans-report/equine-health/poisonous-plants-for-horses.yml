        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Poisonous plants are a concern for all horse owners, especially for those with horses who live out on pasture.&nbsp; Virtually every pasture has some degree of toxic weeds and unwanted plants growing in it.&nbsp; Fortunately, many of these toxic plants are bitter and not very palatable, so most horses will choose to eat other plants instead.&nbsp; Most horses are large enough that if they do consume a poisonous plant, they would need to eat an abundant amount to reach toxic levels.&nbsp; Life-threatening poisonings from plants are not common; however, a range of toxicities can occur.&nbsp; If your horse is out on pasture, it’s important to be able to recognize toxic plants and understand the symptoms they can cause if consumed by your horse.&nbsp; </span></p><br /><image src="~/media/61D8118DE2324B12A1F58560A4E13E7F.ashx" /><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Bracken Fern</strong></span></h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span></span></strong>Bracken fern is a plant that&rsquo;s found throughout North America, but most toxicities occur in the north western states.&nbsp; It contains the enzyme thiaminase, which prevents the absorption of thiamine (vitamin B1) and causes a thiamine deficiency, resulting in blindness, depression, weight loss and uncoordinated gait.&nbsp; For poisoning to occur, a horse must consume large quantities of bracken fern over several weeks.&nbsp; Bracken fern is one of the few toxic plants that horses can develop a taste for, so watch for ferns growing in moist areas of your fields and don&rsquo;t let your horse munch on any ferns while out on the trail.&nbsp; Although horses may find it in their pasture, most toxicities come from feeding poor-quality hay that contains the plant.&nbsp; Horses eating hay that contains 3-5% bracken fern for a month will be affected.&nbsp; If caught early, bracken fern poisoning can be countered by doses of thiamine to restore normal levels.&nbsp; However, the best prevention methods are to maintain good pastures by eliminating any bracken fern found and inspecting hay to ensure it&rsquo;s free of the plant.&nbsp;</p><br /><image src="~/media/896F5C7EB0D44864AC477D3CC890CFA9.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Buttercups and Pokeweed</strong></span></h2> <p>Buttercups and pokeweed are two pasture plants that are found in overgrazed pastures and often thrive in drought conditions.&nbsp; Buttercups are characterized by their yellow cup-shaped flowers with long, thin stem; whereas, pokeweed is a large, bushy weed that grows erect like a tree with a reddish or purple stem and brightly colored purple berries.&nbsp; Pokeweed berries are produced in clusters that start off green and turn a blackish-purple color when mature.&nbsp; The roots are the most toxic part of the plant, but horses can be poisoned by consuming the leaves and stems as well.&nbsp; As pokeweed matures, the leaves and stems increase in toxicity.&nbsp; Since both buttercups and pokeweed are not very palatable, horses will normally avoid eating them if they have access to good quality forage.&nbsp; Dried buttercups, which are sometimes found in hay, are not toxic.&nbsp; When these plants are consumed, they can cause oral irritation (blisters and excess salivation for buttercups; burning sensation of the mouth for pokeweed), diarrhea and gastric upset.&nbsp;    </p><br /><image src="~/media/8CCE86B614CB4AD4A60433023BF2051A.ashx" /><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Yew Plants</strong></span></h2> <p>Yew is one of the most toxic plants for horses.&nbsp; This ornamental plant is native to the west coast, eastern and central parts of the U.S. and seen as landscape shrubs on home properties or even some show grounds.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a woody evergreen shrub with needlelike leaves and bright red berries that have a hole in the end.&nbsp; Yew plants contain taxine, an alkaloid toxin that causes rapid cardiac and respiratory collapse.&nbsp; The highest concentration of taxine is found in the leaves (even dried leaves remain toxic); as little as a mouthful (8-16 oz of yew leaves) can be fatal within 30 minutes of consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms are rarely observed since the toxin works so quickly and equine cases are generally diagnosed after sudden death.&nbsp; There is no antidote or treatment for yew poisoning, so avoidance is critical.&nbsp; Since this is a common ornamental plant, it becomes extremely important to ensure any neighbor trimmings are not thrown into the pasture.&nbsp;</p><br /><image src="~/media/8281CF231CAB4D4F946CFC4FD2EE19CF.ashx" /><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Nightshades</strong></span></h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span></span></strong>There are over 70 species of nightshade plants and many are toxic to horses, including black nightshade, bittersweet nightshade, horse nettle, jimsonweed and even green tomato and potato vines.&nbsp; Nightshade plants are native to North America and mainly found growing in cultivated fields, overgrazed pastures and gardens.&nbsp; They can be identified by their purple or white 5-lobed flowers with berries that turn yellow or black at maturity.&nbsp; All nightshade plants contain a glycoalkaloid called solanine, which significantly affects the horse&rsquo;s central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp; Ingestion of the nightshade plants (either fresh or dried) can cause loss of appetite, excess salivation, weakness, lack of muscle coordination, trembling and gastric upset.&nbsp; Toxicity is highest in the green berries, followed by red or black berries, leaves, stems and roots.&nbsp; It is estimated that the consumption of 1 to 10 lbs. of nightshade is fatal to horses.&nbsp; However, horses don&rsquo;t generally eat these plants and poisoning is more commonly due to nightshade being a contaminant in poor quality hay.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br /><image src="~/media/D2866F4E1FFE4376B5CA0B54303A53BC.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Alsike Clover</strong></span></h2> <p><strong> <span></span></strong><span>Alsike clover is most frequently found</span><span style="background: white; color: #333333;"> across the northern states of the U.S. and in Canada and can be used for hay, pasture or soil improvement.&nbsp; It has small pink flowers (that turn brown at maturity) on long stems that are 1 to 2 feet in height.&nbsp; Alsike clover is known for causing photosensitization (short-term exposure) and liver damage (long-term exposure), as well as possible nitrate poisoning.&nbsp; Horses consuming hay or pasture with as little as 20% of alsike clover can begin to show signs of liver damage and can be fatal.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="background: white;

color: #333333;"> is when a horse&rsquo;s white skin becomes sensitized to sunlight.&nbsp; It causes reddening of the skin, painful lesions, swelling, discharge and the skin will eventually slough-off.&nbsp; Photosensitization most </span><span style="background: white; color: black;">commonly affects the white areas on a horse&rsquo;s face and legs.&nbsp; </span></p><br /><image src="~/media/95C46A896F84499D9C04E746FD7AB918.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Ragwort</strong></span></h2> <p><strong> <span></span></strong><span>Ragwort is another plant that is highly toxic to horses.&nbsp; There are about 70 different species of ragwort, such as tansy ragwort and St. Johns wort, and are recognized by their 13-petal daisy-like, yellow flowers.&nbsp; All parts of the ragwort plant are toxic, eaten both fresh and dried in hay.&nbsp; Ragwort contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which affect the liver by inhibiting cell division.&nbsp; These toxins are cumulative in effect and when consumed over an extended period of time cause irreversible liver damage.&nbsp; Affected horses may be jaundiced and will show neurologic signs from toxin accumulation due to the liver failure.&nbsp; There is no effective treatment for advanced stages of liver disease from this toxin.&nbsp; Unfortunately, since there normally aren&rsquo;t any early signs of consumption, most horses already have advanced and irreversible liver damage by the time it&rsquo;s noticed.&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br /><image src="~/media/1BD7AFBFCFD3451BB473D7EEADA28C15.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Red Maple Trees</strong></span></h2> <p><strong> <span style="color: #1f1f26;"></span></strong><span style="color: #1f1f26;">Red </span><span>maple trees grow throughout the eastern portion of the U.S.; they are extremely toxic to horses and one of the most common plant-based poisonings in horses.&nbsp; They are well-known for their leaves that turn bright red in the fall and are frequently found growing in or near pastures where horses are kept.&nbsp; While fresh, green leaves are apparently not toxic if ingested, the tree bark and wilted leaves are highly dangerous and unfortunately have a sweet taste and are more palatable to horses.&nbsp; Wilted leaves are commonly found on tree branches that have fallen into the pasture during a storm, and during autumn months when leaves drop to the ground.&nbsp; The leaves can remain toxic for about a month, so it&rsquo;s best to immediately remove any that are accessible to horses.&nbsp; The toxin in red maple leaves affects the red blood cells, reducing their ability to carry oxygen and can cause severe kidney damage.&nbsp; It is estimated that poisoning will occur from the consumption of approximately 1.5 lb. of leaves.&nbsp; Depending on the amount consumed, symptoms can appear within a few hours or a few days.&nbsp; Signs of toxicity include lethargy, jaundiced to brown gum color, dark brown urine, breathing difficulties, increased heart rate and death.&nbsp; The only treatment available is to administer IV fluids and possibly a blood transfusion; however, survival depends on the amount of leaves consumed and how quickly supportive care is provided.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/61B4FA3CAD3942F29B50AF798387CC21.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong>Poison Hemlock and Water Hemlock</strong></span></h2> <p><strong> <span></span></strong><span>Poison hemlock and water hemlock are two very toxic plants for horses.&nbsp; These plants look somewhat similar with their clusters of white flowers but can be differentiated by their leaves; poison hemlock has small fern-like leaves and water hemlock has larger leaves with jagged edges.&nbsp; They also grow in different areas; poison hemlock along roadsides or uncultivated areas, while water hemlock prefers the marshy areas of meadows and alongside streams and irrigation ditches.&nbsp; Both plants affect a horse&rsquo;s nervous system when ingested but do so via different neurotoxins.&nbsp; The leaves, stems and seeds are the most toxic parts of the poison hemlock.&nbsp; Toxicity increases throughout the growing season, especially in their parsnips-like roots.&nbsp; Poison hemlock contains potent neurotoxins that affect the central and peripheral nervous systems.&nbsp; Symptoms of poisoning can occur within 1 to 2 hours of consumption and include increased salivation, nervousness, muscle tremors, incoordination and increased respiratory and heart rates.&nbsp; A horse must consume 4 to 5 lbs. of poison hemlock for it to be fatal, and usually dies due to respiratory failure.&nbsp; Water hemlock, on the other hand, is even more toxic than poison hemlock and as little as 8 oz. can be fatal.&nbsp; All parts of the water hemlock (especially the roots) contain an extremely poisonous neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system.&nbsp; Toxin levels in the leaves and stems decreases as the plant grows, but the roots remain toxic year-round.&nbsp; Signs of poisoning include excess salivation, breathing difficulties, nervousness, violent muscle tremors and convulsions, and death from respiratory paralysis.&nbsp; The onset of symptoms will occur one hour after consumption and death follows typically within 2 to 3 hours.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><image src="~/media/01B97C38256142AA8EAB41ABBB2B87AB.ashx" ></image><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Black Walnut Tree</span></strong></h2> <p> <span>The black walnut tree is an interesting poisonous plant.&nbsp; The bark, wood, nuts and roots of the black walnut tree are toxic if ingested; however, most horses rarely eat the leaves or chew on the bark.&nbsp; Horses are primarily poisoned through exposure by shavings that contain parts of the black walnut tree.&nbsp; Bedding that contains 20% or more black walnut shavings will cause toxicity in as little as 10-12 hours after oral or skin contact.&nbsp; Black walnut shavings can be identified by its dark brown color and will stand out from regular light tan shavings.&nbsp; Signs of toxicity include reluctance to move, shifting weight from limb to limb, warm hooves, leg edema and an increased digital pulse.&nbsp; If the affected horse is removed from the black walnut shavings early enough, most symptoms will disappear within a few hours.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s always best to have the horse checked out by a veterinarian to make sure there&rsquo;s no long-term effects and continuously check your shavings before bedding your horse&rsquo;s stall.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span> </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s a long list of other plants that are toxic to horses.&nbsp; You can talk to your veterinarian or contact your state cooperative extension to ask which toxic plants are common in your area and should look out for.&nbsp; </span>When in doubt, take a sample of the plant in question to your veterinarian or use online resources to help identify unknown plants.<span>&nbsp;

</span>Make sure you walk your fields looking for potential poisonous plants on a regular basis and remove anything suspicious looking immediately.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most horses will avoid toxic plants unless their pastures are overgrazed or suffering from drought conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>In those situations, try to provide safe forage options such as good quality hay.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="background: white; letter-spacing: 0.3pt;
