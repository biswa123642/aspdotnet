      Hint: SubText
      Value: "(S)-Methoprene is an insect growth regulator. Rather than killing insects, it controls them by interfering with normal hormone levels within the insect at critical development periods preventing growth and/or maturation. It is active by contact or ingestion and in some insects (e.g., fleas) it affects eggs or female fecundity. (S)-Methoprene controls a broad range of insects including diptera, hymenoptera, coleoptera, homoptera and syphonaptera. Use patterns include post-harvest grain protection, mosquito larvae control, as a preventative of flea-egg development and as a feed-through for the control of horn fly larvae in cattle manure. In the U.S., (S)-methoprene has been exempted from food tolerances by the EPA."
