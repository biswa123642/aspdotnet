      Value: "Diflubenzuron is a chitin synthesis inhibitor, which is another type of insect growth regulator. The chitin synthesis inhibitors interfere with the normal synthesis of insect exoskeletons during molting or at hatching of eggs. Diflubenzuron is a non-systemic active ingredient with contact and stomach activity. It is used to control a wide range of leaf-eating insects in forestry, woody ornamentals and fruit. It controls some major pests in cotton, soy beans, citrus, tea, vegetables, rice, peanuts, tree nuts and mushrooms. Diflubenzuron also controls larvae of flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers and migratory locusts. Due to its selectivity and rapid degradation, as well as high solubility in water and soil, diflubenzuron is less harmful to beneficial insects and thus a good candidate for integrated pest management (IPM) programs."
