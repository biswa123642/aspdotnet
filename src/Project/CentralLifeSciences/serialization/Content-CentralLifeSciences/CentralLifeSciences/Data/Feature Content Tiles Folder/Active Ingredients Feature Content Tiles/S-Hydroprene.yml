      Value: "(S)-Hydroprene is another insect growth regulator that controls insects by interfering with normal hormone levels within the insect at critical development periods preventing growth and/or maturation. It is active by contact or ingestion and in some insects (e.g., roaches) it affects eggs or female fecundity. (S)-Hydroprene is mainly used to control insects such as cockroaches, stored product pests, fruit flies, drain flies and bed bugs in buildings and commercial food and non-food establishments."
