        <p>Central Life Sciences is invested in innovation through information. We not only invest significant resources into developing solutions, we are committed to better understanding the problems. That&rsquo;s why we partner with a variety of institutions to study the impact insects have on the markets we proudly serve.</p> <p>This research has perhaps been no more impactful than our efforts into the connection between flies and livestock disease.</p> <p>Recent partnering efforts have explored the possibility for flies to spread diseases to pigs, including PEDV and Senecavirus A. After extensive studies with Grant Allison, DVM, a veterinarian at the Walcott (Iowa) Veterinary Clinic, and Iowa State University, the study confirmed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/blog/new-research-confirms-flys-can-spread-disease" target="_blank">groundbreaking revelation that flies can infect pigs</a> with these costly and devastating diseases.</p> <p>Building on that study, Central Life Sciences has supported Dr. Alllison in his <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/flies-and-prrs?web=1&amp;wdLOR=cC867C01C-939E-874B-8E3D-1FE1117C70AA" target="_blank">research of a new variant</a> within the porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome (PRRS) lineage. Specifically, he spoke about how fly control can help prevent the spread of PRRS.</p> <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough potential evidence showing that flies can propagate the spread of PRRS. As fly control is usually seen as effective, farms should have a standard operating procedure for integrated pest management. Plus, it&rsquo;s cost effective and employees appreciate it.&rdquo;</p> <p>While the disease-spreading connection between flies and cattle is better established, there continues to be ongoing research to further understand the threat. Bovine Respiratory Disease accounts for $900 million in feedlot losses annually and is responsible for 70% of all cattle deaths in feedlots. While long associated with other causes including shipping, Central Life Sciences <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/blog/house-flies-pose-risk-of-brd" target="_blank">led a research initiative</a> that confirmed house flies may be a culprit in harboring BRD pathogens and transmitting them to cattle.</p> <p>For the study, 60 house flies were collected from a commercial cattle feedlot in Kansas during a BRD outbreak to examine the link between the flies and the transmission of BRD bacterial pathogens. Using two different methods of bacterial detection, the house fly samples that were tested contained levels of specific bacteria indicating that house flies may serve as a potential vector for BRD within feedlots and surrounding areas. While more research is needed, this study further emphasized the importance of protecting cattle from flies.</p> <p>Central Life Sciences is dedicated to providing the most recent and useful information for the industries we serve. We&rsquo;re always questioning the &ldquo;wheres&rdquo; and &ldquo;whys&rdquo; of the problems that livestock operations face and how research can lead to innovative solutions. That means exploring the threat flies pose to the health of animals and discovering ways to improve the overall profitability of the operation. If you ever have a question about our research or any industry trends, reach out to your brand representative. They&rsquo;re well-versed in all of the latest research and will happily roll up their sleeves to provide the answers and insights you need.</p>
