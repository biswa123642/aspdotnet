        <p>An insect infestation can seriously compromise the success of your rice harvest. The best way to keep monster bugs like the rice weevil and red flour beetle from eating into your profits is to prevent infestations by following proper grain treatment techniques.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this blog, we&rsquo;ll offer the information on tools you need to keep stored grain insects out of your rice, including the products that can help you prevent profit-robbing rice infestations. </p>
        <h2>Insect Prevention
        </h2>
        <p>Being proactive is the most effective way to prevent stored grain insect infestations. Before the harvest season, make sure to clean empty bins and agriculture equipment thoroughly. The goal is to ensure the entire storage facility is free of trace grains from previous storage.
        </p>
        <p>Everything must be cleaned properly, including harvest equipment, augers and belts to eliminate any old and potentially infested grain.
        </p>
        <p>After you&rsquo;re done cleaning, treat your bins and equipment with Diacon<strong style="color: #202124; background-color: #ffffff;">&reg;</strong> IGR PLUS or Gravista&trade; Insecticide. All you have to do is use a low-pressure sprayer and apply your preferred formula as a surface, spot and crack-and-crevice treatment both inside and outside of your bins.
        </p>
        <h2>Profit Protection
        </h2>
        <p>Balance is critical once the time comes to load your rice post-harvest into storage. Storing rice requires a measured defense against insects that could lead to damaged grain and a reduced bottom line.
        </p>
        <p>After thoroughly cleaning and following the proper sanitation procedures for your rice storage facilities, it&rsquo;s time to bring in your newly harvested rice. This loading step is where to treat the incoming grain based on your storage requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Central Life Sciences offers proven post-harvest grain protectant products that control insect infestations and protect your profits. What&rsquo;s more, products in this versatile lineup have CODEX approval for international flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>Diacon<strong style="color: #202124; background-color: #ffffff;">&reg;</strong> IGR PLUS is a versatile liquid formulation and combination product as an insect growth regulator and adulticide.
        </p>
        <p>Bug Free Grains has also recently introduced product solutions that require no tank-mixing: Gravista&trade; Insecticide and Centynal&trade; Synergized Insecticide. Gravista&trade; Insecticide is a liquid concentrate for on-grain, empty-bin, and perimeter* treatments. Combining an adulticide, an insect growth regulator, and a synergist, this 3-in-1 product kills labeled stored grain insects and breaks their life cycles. Centynal&trade; Synergized Insecticide brings a boost to short-term grain storage and rescue treatments by combining both an adulticide and a synergist, effective anywhere grain is stored.
