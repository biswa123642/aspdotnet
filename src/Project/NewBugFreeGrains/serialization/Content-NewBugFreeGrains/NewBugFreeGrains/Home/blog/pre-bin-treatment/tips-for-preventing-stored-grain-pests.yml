        <p>The most effective approach to preventing insect infestations in stored grain requires a comprehensive integrated pest management program supported by the use of stored grain protectants. When applying liquid grain protectants such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0D740F4784D145B0B551527197E8E102&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AF0021634852455C802076CEBE7F7F7C&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR <em>PLUS</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C75C15245B4E46A191A87B6F252EB1CD&amp;_z=z">Centynal&trade; EC Insecticide</a>, it is essential to get complete coverage on grain as it is loaded into storage. This list of tips and tricks can help you stay protected from stored grain pests as well as provide you with other valuable information about keeping accurate records, setting effective spray pressure, achieving proper agitation and more.</p>
        <h2>Tip #1: Keep Grain Storage Application Records</h2>
        <p>Keep a daily record of applications to stored grain. Don&rsquo;t risk under- or over-treating your stored commodities. Keep a simple record of the date, amount of grain treated and amount of chemical used, on paper or as a digital record, for future reference.</p>
        <h2>Tip #2: Ensure Proper Application of Stored Grain Insect Protectants</h2>
        <p>During product application, droplets should be at least 157-360 microns, producing coarse or very coarse droplets.</p>
        <p>Select the proper nozzle type to control spray droplet size. A flat-fan or cone nozzle with a coarse spray will yield optimal size droplets, further ensuring drift elimination.</p>
        <h2>Tip #3: Use a Low Spray Pressure on Stored Grains </h2>
        <p>Keep spray pressure at 20-25 psi. Using a higher pressure will create finer droplets that are far more likely to drift, limiting the product&rsquo;s effectiveness in controlling stored grain pests.</p>
        <h2>Tip #4: Aim Where Grain Drops Enter Your Grain Storage Bins </h2>
        <p>When positioning your spraying equipment in relation to the grain stream, aim as close as possible to the point where the grain drops into the grain storage bins, and spray in a manner that hits the grain and not the adjoining equipment. Test the direction and formation of your spray pattern as you begin, and make adjustments as necessary to avoid poor coverage or wasted product.</p>
        <p>Adding more nozzles to improve coverage is also encouraged. If the spray stops or changes pattern unexpectedly, be sure to turn your sprayer off before checking the nozzles for clogs.</p>
        <h2>Tip #5: Don&rsquo;t Forget To Turn the Spray Equipment On!</h2>
        <p>This tip may seem obvious, but it can be easy to overlook.</p>
        <h2>Tip #6: Use the Right Pump For the Job</h2>
        <p>To help keep the mixture properly agitated, select a pump with enough volume to both apply and return the right amount of solution. Adding mechanical agitation to the tank is also a viable option.</p>
        <p>Central Life Sciences offers proven post-harvest grain protectant products that control insect infestations ranging from rice weevils to Indian meal moths and more. By selecting the right products for your operation and following these application tips, you can help protect your commodities from stored grain insects.</p>
