        <p>Stored grain insects destroy up to 10% of the U.S. grain crop every year during post-harvest infestations, costing the industry upwards of $2.5 billion a year. Controlling stored product pests, including weevils and Indian meal moths, is the first step to protecting stored commodities and profits. For the most effective control of grain bugs, incorporate products from the Bug Free Grains lineup of solutions from Central Life Sciences into a comprehensive integrated pest management (IPM) program. We recommend an IPM program designed to protect grain quality from weather, rodents, insects and molds through four simple steps:
        </p>
        <h2>Thoroughly Clean Facilities and Grain Storage Units
        </h2>
        <p>This first step is often viewed as the most important when it comes to starting your post-harvest handling off right. The two biggest aspects of this step are cleaning and repairing your grain storage facilities. While inspecting your facility, keep an eye out for any damages that need repairing, especially cracks or holes, as they can be an easy entry way allowing grain insects into your stored grain. Before any new grain can be loaded in, it&rsquo;s crucial to thoroughly clean empty grain bins inside and outside of the structure, removing any old commodity. Once completed, there should be no visible sign of the grain last stored in the structure. This includes cleaning grain handling equipment. Now is also the time to incorporate stored grain protectants. Before loading in new grain, use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AF0021634852455C802076CEBE7F7F7C&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR PLUS</a>&nbsp;as an empty bin treatment to help eliminate any remaining insect populations and prevent future generations from emerging.
        </p>
        <h2>Ensure Proper Grain Loading
        </h2>
        <p>After thoroughly cleaning and following the proper sanitation procedures for your grain bins and facilities, it&rsquo;s time to bring in your new commodity. This loading step is where to treat the incoming grain based on your storage requirements. Directly applying grain protectants such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0D740F4784D145B0B551527197E8E102&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AF0021634852455C802076CEBE7F7F7C&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR PLUS</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0555AA5A5AF14B8BB84ECCC4016A5E2A&amp;_z=z">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup>-D IGR</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C75C15245B4E46A191A87B6F252EB1CD&amp;_z=z">Centynal<sup>&trade;</sup> EC Insecticide</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E187C7445D1E46A1B80DDF73A434E91B&amp;_z=z">PBO-8<sup>&reg;</sup> Synergist</a>&nbsp;to treat the incoming grain stream controls grain bug infestations and protects your new commodity. Watch our tips and tricks video to help you maximize the effectiveness of your stored product applications. While treating the product, it is essential to allow for optimal circulation by evenly spreading the grain as it enters the storage facility.
        </p>
        <h2>Place an Emphasis on Stored Grain Aeration
        </h2>
        <p>Grain insects thrive in warm, moist habitats. To slow down their reproduction rate and reduce mold growth, keep your grain cool and moisture free. Make sure to properly cool stored grain and keep it leveled, rather than peaked, allowing for better air movement.
        </p>
        <h2>Implement a Grain Monitoring System</h2>
        <p>
        Don&rsquo;t let all your hard work go to waste! Stay ahead of future problems and insect infestations by regularly keeping track of your progress and checking for heating or any signs of infestations in the grain. Temperature probes, insect traps and core samplers are perfect tools to help protect your bottom line.
