        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Reddish-brown body 1/8&rdquo; long; last three segments of antennae as distinct club.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Egg to adult within 30 days; adults can live up to 18 months
        </p>
        <p><strong>Feeding Habits:</strong> Generally classified as a scavenger, immature stages feed on broken or damaged grains. A common pest in mills and warehouses that store milled/bagged grain products.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Signs of Infestation:</strong> Presence of adult beetles cause food to have pungent odor, foul taste and potentially a pink coloration.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Control Tips:</strong> Priority is cleaning; empty bins, and equipment should be free of grain debris. After cleaning, treat bins with <a href="/products/diacon-igr-plus">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR <em>PLUS</em></a>. Treat received grain with <a href="/products/diacon-igr">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR</a>&nbsp;or <a href="/products/diacon-igr-plus">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR <em>PLUS</em></a>; aerate grain during warm periods of storage to help control moisture and temperature; monitor grain throughout storage period.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Application Tips:</strong><span> When treating flowing grain on belts or at transitions, 2 or more nozzles are recommended; during auger or conveyor cup application, fewer nozzles may be used; position nozzles for full coverage of grain stream; avoid spraying onto sides of auger boots. Calibrate protectant flow rate and check often to help ensure proper application. Use automated switches to turn chemical pumps on when there is grain in the system and turn off when no grain is present.</span></p>
