        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Small brownish moth, about 3/8&rdquo; long, 1/2&rdquo; - 3/4&rdquo; wing span; distinctive rusty brown or bronze wing tips; larvae are off-white with brown heads, about 2/3&rdquo; long.</p>
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Minimum 42 days; adult moths do not feed, typically die within a week after laying eggs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Feeding Habits:</strong> Larvae are generally top feeders, 4 to 6 inches from some type of surface; found in many types of pantry foods as well as processing and storage facilities.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Signs of Infestation:</strong> Larvae produce dense webbing that binds to food fragments; adults present flying in vicinity of grain bin, larvae climbing up walls inside bins.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Control Tips:</strong> Clean empty bins and treat them with <a href="/products/diacon-igr-plus">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR <em>PLUS</em></a>; treat received grain with <a href="/products/diacon-igr">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR</a>&nbsp;or <a href="/products/diacon-igr-plus">Diacon<sup>&reg;</sup> IGR <em>PLUS</em></a>; aerate grain during warm periods of storage to help control moisture and temperature; monitor grain during entire storage period.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Application Tips:</strong> When treating flowing grain on belts or at transitions, 2 or more nozzles are recommended; during auger or conveyor cup application, fewer nozzles may be used; position nozzles for full coverage of grain stream; avoid spraying onto sides of auger boots. Calibrate protectant flow rate and check often to help ensure proper application. Use automated switches to turn chemical pumps on when there is grain in the system and turn off when no grain is present.</p>
