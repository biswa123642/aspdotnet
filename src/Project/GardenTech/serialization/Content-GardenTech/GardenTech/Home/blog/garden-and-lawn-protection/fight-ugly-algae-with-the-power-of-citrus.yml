        <p>When slimy green algae overtake your outdoor spaces, the invasion puts a definitive damper on outdoor activities. Algae infiltrate quietly in spring, often going unnoticed, and then build <a></a>through hot, humid summer days until the slime is suddenly everywhere. Patios, lawns, siding, roofs &mdash; even your favorite outdoor lounge chairs &mdash; aren't immune to the green invasion. Common herbicides and harsh cleansers won't get rid of algae, but you can put an end to the ugliness with botanical help from one of America's favorite citrus fruits &mdash; the orange.</p>

        <p><strong>The 411 on Algae</strong></p>
        <p>When first settling in, algae can go unnoticed. Very primitive members of the plant kingdom, algae lack true roots, stems and leaves. Their spores drift in on wind, dust or water, and then bide their time until hot, humid weather conditions hit. Once they jump into action, they leave in their wake everything from slippery stones and slimy turf to green siding and black-streaked roofs.</p>
        <p>Algae need some sunlight and nutrients, but constant moisture is their survival key. You'll find algae lurking, with various degrees of slime, where humidity and other moisture accumulate and conditions limit air circulation. When moisture passes, untreated algae turn hard and green-black in color.</p>
        <h2>Why Traditional Approaches Fail</h2>
        <p>Without roots and a vascular system, algae don't react to traditional herbicides the way common plants do. Many products rely on a plant's internal plumbing to move through its leaves, stems and roots to kill it. Because algae lack that internal passage, products can't penetrate, so algae continue to spread. Like mosses, the top layer of algae insulates the bottom layers. Even tough traditional herbicides known to kill most plants on contact have little or no impact on algae.</p>
        <p>To complicate treatment, many effective moss- and algae-fighting products depend on iron to do the job. While they banish algae, iron-based products can leave natural, rust-like stains on many outdoor surfaces &mdash; including your concrete, brick and stone &mdash; which limits use near your home and in your landscape.</p>
