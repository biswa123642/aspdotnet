        <p>Ticks and tick bites aren't restricted to woodland walks and camping adventures. The truth behind these pests strikes closer to home. You and your family are most likely to contract common tick-related diseases from ticks encountered in your own lawn and garden.1 Understanding the answers to these common tick questions can help you protect your family:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When are ticks most active?</li>
            <li>Where do ticks typically hide?</li>
            <li>Why is effective tick control important?</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: lighter;">How can you protect against ticks?</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="`'z-index:;">When are ticks most active?</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, common ticks in your area may stay active year-round. However, tick activity generally kicks into high gear from April through September. It increases as weather warms &mdash; and people and animals become more active outside, too.</p>
        <p>Immature, pinhead-size ticks called "nymphs" are responsible for approximately 98% of all tick bites. Nymph activity &mdash; and the transmission of tick-related diseases such as Lyme disease &mdash; tends to peak from May through July.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <img alt="" src="~/media/9F457A4DC8AB4E86941B44525FADBBCB.ashx" />
        <div style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: lighter;">Ticks are commonly found among tall grasses and weeds.</em></div>
        <h2 style="`'z-index:;">Where do ticks typically hide?</h2>
        <p>It may seem as though ticks drop down from tree branches, because they're often found hidden in hair. However, they actually start closer to the ground. Favorite hiding spots include naturalized or unmown areas with weeds and tall grasses, especially when those spots are humid and shady.</p>
        <p>When lawns are nearby, ticks move into mowed areas, too. But more than 80% stay in the lawn's outer 9 feet. Low-lying ground covers and low-hanging shrubs in gardens or foundation plantings are also prime spots for ticks.</p>
        <p>Ticks typically move onto humans or animals that brush against grasses or weeds when passing by. Then ticks climb upward and find a spot to bite and feed. An estimated 75% of tick bites occur from ticks picked up during normal home activities such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7C69E4B542B14621B2D257797026D848&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">starting a new garden</a>, playing with pets and kids, or entertaining friends.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <img alt="" src="~/media/B50E7FE826634B81A0BF9A19348C9A30.ashx" />
        <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;"><em>Engorged female ticks lay thousands of eggs.</em></span></div>
        <h2 style="`'z-index:;">Why is effective tick control important?</h2>
        <p>Tick problems don't go away on their own &mdash; they multiply. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease typically lay eggs in batches of 3,000 or more. Some types of ticks lay up to 15,000 eggs before they die.<sup>1</sup> Untreated ticks may live for several years, and some types can even live indoors.</p>
        <p>No U.S. region is free from the threat of ticks and tick-transmitted disease. Across the country, tick populations and diseases are on the rise.<sup>2</sup> Reactions to tick bites range from mild itching to serious, even deadly conditions, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, tick-induced paralysis and Powassan virus.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <img alt="" src="~/media/844B11E403ED4AB3A53F8E9582A81558.ashx" />
        <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;"><em>Ticks bites can be painful and potentially dangerous.</em></span></div>
        <h2 style="`'z-index:;">How can you protect against ticks?</h2>
        <p>Take steps against ticks by making your lawn and garden less attractive to these pests. Keep areas free of tall grass, weeds and garden debris &mdash; you'll also discourage small rodents, which transport ticks. Place outdoor play and entertainment areas in sunny, airy spots, away from tick-prone zones. Most importantly, eliminate existing ticks and create a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2C691A788CFD4368ABCC1C973E5A40BC&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">perimeter of protection</a>&nbsp;around your home with effective tick control treatment.</p>
