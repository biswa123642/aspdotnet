        Starting your own vegetable garden opens a whole new world. You're no longer limited to supermarket varieties. You control what goes into your food. And you enjoy fresh-from-the-garden nutrition unmatched by supermarket produce. Even if you're a first-time gardener, starting a vegetable garden isn't hard. Just follow these vegetable garden basics, and you'll soon be harvesting homegrown garden crops:

        <h2 style="`'z-index:;"><a name="Choose"><span style="color: #558f45;">How to Choose Your Garden Spot</span></a></h2>
        Vegetable gardens need at least six to eight hours of direct sun each day for peak productivity. The more sun your vegetables receive, the bigger and better your harvests. Warm sunny gardens attract <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=96A26F1E15E449E88928BF1FA3E199AC&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">more pollinators</a>, ensuring blossoms on <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FADBF65E2F504527BA2B6617035FE8F7&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">tasty tomatoes</a>&nbsp;and other fruiting vegetables get pollinated and produce crops. If you garden in southern climates with intense hot sun, choose a spot with plentiful morning sun and afternoon shade.  Well-drained, level areas are ideal for vegetable gardening. Vegetables don't like soggy feet, but they also don't tolerate irrigation that runs off instead of soaking in. Choose a site away from trees. Their leaves shade your vegetables, and their roots steal water and nutrients meant for crops.  If you love to cook, consider a spot close to the kitchen door, so fresh herbs and veggies are close at hand. Simplify watering with a faucet or hose connection nearby, too. If you're short on space, that's okay. You can <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=98300B2FBCD14A45925C02B9384315CA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">grow your vegetable garden in containers</a>.  Raised garden boxes and raised beds offer options for backyards and balconies. The boxes elevate your garden above ground level, so it's easier to tend and harvest. Plus, you can premix a perfect blend of organic matter, soil and nutrients. If <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D04B5F2244504852BC1C0B28BC9747BD&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">cucumbers</a>&nbsp;or other vining crops make your list, you can take garden goals higher with a trellis.<img alt="" src="~/media/AE5BCC18FA044A9F8C92808A4ABDC4A8.ashx" />

        <h2 style="`'z-index:;"><a name="Prepare"><span style="color: #558f45;">How to Prepare Vegetable Garden Soil</span></a></h2>
        Don't rush to plant when spring arrives. Soil usually needs time to dry. Working your garden before it's ready compacts soil and damages soil structure. That makes it harder for vegetables to grow well. Before your start, squeeze a handful of soil. If it forms a firm clump, it's too wet. If it crumbles when your hand opens, it's ready.  <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Soil testing</a>&nbsp;helps ensure your vegetables thrive. Test results reveal soil pH and recommend <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6042EC370E1449AEAE9BB1C58548626E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">soil amendments</a>. Vegetables grow best in fertile soil, rich in organic matter with pH between 6.0 to 7.0. Improve your soil by working a layer of organic compost down 6 inches deep, the growing zone for most vegetable roots.  Without sufficient calcium, vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and melons suffer blossom end rot disease. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=58D2412EB60A41F5B078BCE1E29A134C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Garden lime</a>&nbsp;restores balance to overly acidic soil and provides added calcium. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3BE198121E6E492E824CFC6FE148657E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Garden gypsum</a>&nbsp;adds calcium without altering soil pH.

        <h2 style="`'z-index:;"><a name="Plant"><span style="color: #558f45;">How to Plant a Vegetable Garden</span></a></h2>
        Most common U.S. garden vegetables get replanted every year. They naturally die at season's end or succumb to winter. Some vegetables are grown <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FAB75010837F4FFD95A66CCB86772A03&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">from seeds planted directly outside</a>. Others need early starts indoors. Tropical natives, such as tomatoes and peppers, require longer growing seasons than many U.S. gardens provide. Most gardeners grow these vegetables from small plants called transplants to provide a head start.  Take time to learn whether seeds or transplants are your best choice for the vegetables you want to grow. If you're unsure what works best in your area, your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">local county extension office</a>&nbsp;can help.  Think of the vegetables you and your family love to eat and focus on those. If this is your first garden, consider <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BBCA442A365470585C093B96CDBD7ED&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">easy fruits and veggies for beginners</a>.

Vegetable seed packets explain when and how deep to plant, how far to space seeds, and when to expect a harvest. Plant tags on vegetable transplants have planting, spacing and harvest times, too.  Some vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach and kale, love cool temperatures. Their seeds go straight into cool spring soil. Plant these seeds every two to three weeks and keep harvesting right up to summer heat. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E6BEE57BF1DA4F96B39FCEC726CF0D50&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Bell pepper</a>, eggplant and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1D84F5DFB01D447EA0CF3E7F10FDA38C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">zucchini squash</a>&nbsp;transplants don't go out until danger of spring frost has passed.  You can plant vegetables in tidy rows or get creative. Anything goes in your garden as long as you space your vegetables well. You can even intersperse vegetables with garden flowers and other plants in an <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=92C380D1729846BAA1CEE1FCEC24DFCF&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">edible landscape</a>&nbsp;that delivers food, flowers and color.<img alt="" src="~/media/2C855C5C2C90426681E4A36FB8E6469C.ashx" />

        <h2 style="`'z-index:;"><a name="Maintain"><span style="color: #558f45;">How to Maintain a Vegetable Garden</span></a></h2>
        <p>Without consistent moisture, vegetables can't flourish. Give your vegetable garden at least 1 inch of water per week, including rain. That's enough to wet soil 6 to 8 inches deep. When soil dries 1 to 2 inches deep, water thoroughly. Water early in the day, so leaves dry well before evening.</p>
        <p>Vegetables are heavy feeders. Fertilize your crops every 12 to 16 weeks with the same fertilizer used at planting time. Supplement with natural-based <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A7A764A9613F469AAF39AB73170F183C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Alaska Fish Fertilizer 5-1-1</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=30B0FDFA8C024FE49E2AB0C279D87541&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Alaska Morbloom 0-10-10</a>&nbsp;for bigger, better harvests.</p>
