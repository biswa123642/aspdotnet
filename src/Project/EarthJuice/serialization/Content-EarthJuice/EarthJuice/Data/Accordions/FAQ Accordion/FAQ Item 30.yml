        <p>Presuming you are in soil and are hand-feeding with the Sugar Peak Vegetative formula, first read the instructions on the label that state for hand-feeding use at 1/2 strength. The recommended strength for a Recovery System (hydroponics) is 4 tsp (20ml) per gallon. 1/2 strength would be 10ml to be used at each watering (feeding). At 30 ml/g you are currently using 238ppm of Nitrogen, which is at the higher end of Nitrogen requirements for most container plants especially if using with each watering (feeding). So it is not a Nitrogen deficiency.</p>
        <p>Other common causes of yellowing: Insufficient or shaded lighting and/or over watering. If only the lower leaves are yellowing and you are using the Sugar Peak Vegetative at 30ml/g this could be from insufficient lighting. The general signs of over watering are yellowing progressing to the top of the plant following by leaves drying out and becoming brittle. Suggestions to prevent over watering:</p>
        <p>&ndash; Use a breathable container.</p>
        <p>&ndash; When transplanting starts, do not transplant into too large of a container. The &ldquo;Rule of Thumb&rdquo; when transplanting starts is to not increase the container size by more than 3 times the volume of the starts current/original container. NOTE: If you want to move into a larger container, do so with caution by making sure to use a breathable container, increase aeration (see Aerorock), make sure there is sufficient lighting, good air movement, and use a moisture meter to determine when to water (feed).</p>
