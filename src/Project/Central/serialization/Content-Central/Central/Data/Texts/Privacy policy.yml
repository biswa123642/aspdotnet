        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        At Central we take the protection of your Personal Data seriously. We make
        every reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, loss, or
        theft of your Personal Data. Central employees who have access to your
        Personal Data are made aware of the importance of keeping it confidential.
        Where we collect your payment card information, we will comply with all
        applicable Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS).
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        When we rely on service providers that may require access to your Personal
        Information, we require them to have adequate privacy and security standards.
        We use contracts and other legally binding measures with our service providers
        to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data, and to
        prevent such information from being used for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        However, no data security measures can guarantee complete security; we also
        depend on you to take common sense steps to ensure your Personal Information
        remains secure.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not
        completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we
        cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our
        Platforms. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not
        responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
        contained on our Platforms.

        Before complying with your request, we will need to verify that it is you that
        is making the request. To accomplish this, you may be requested to (1) confirm
        specific Personal Information that we already know about you; and/or (2)
        provide us with appropriate identification and documentation as we request.
        California consumers are limited to two requests for Personal Information per
        twelve-month period.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Only you or an authorized agent may make a verifiable data subject request
        related to your Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        The verifiable data subject request must provide sufficient information and
        documentation to allow us to verify that you (or an authorized agent) are the
        person about whom we collected Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        We will not provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity
        and/or authority to make the data subject request and confirm the Personal
        Data belongs to you or the represented individual. We use Personal Data
        provided in a verifiable data subject request solely to verify the requestor's
        identity or authority to make the request.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        We will acknowledge receipt of your data request within 10 days. We will
        respond to a verifiable data subject request within 45 days of its receipt. If
        we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and
        extension period. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response
        to the email address for that account. If you do not have an account with us,
        we will deliver our response by US mail or electronically at the email address
        in your request, at your option. All disclosures we provide will only cover
        the 12-month period preceding the verifiable employee request's receipt. The
        response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
        request, if applicable.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable data subject
        request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
        determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
        decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
