        This Cookie Policy explains how Central Garden &amp; Pet and our affiliates use
        cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
        Website(s) owned and controlled by Central Garden &amp; Pet. It explains what
        these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control
        our use of them.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>What are Cookies?</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that
        you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more
        efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
        Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Cookies provide a convenient feature to save you time or tell the web server
        you returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our
        Websites, a cookie helps us recall your specific information on subsequent
        visits. When you return to the same Website, we can easily retrieve the
        information you previously entered or settings you modified, allowing you to
        easily use those customized features each time you return.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Cookies that the website owner (in this case, Central Garden &amp; Pet) sets are
        called "first party cookies." Cookies that parties other than the website
        owner set are called "third party cookies." Third party cookies enable us to
        provide third party features or functionality on or through the website (e.g.
        advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties setting these
        third-party cookies can recognize your computer when it visits our Websites,
        and certain other websites.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Why do we use Cookies?</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Our website
        needs some cookies to operate. We refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
        necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target your
        interests, which enhances your experience on our Websites.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        For example, Central Garden &amp; Pet tracks the Websites, and pages you visit
        within those Websites, to determine its most popular and widely used portions.
        We then use this data to deliver customized content and promotions within the
        Central Garden &amp; Pet Website to customers whose behavior indicates an interest
        in a subject area. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for
        advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail
        below.
        </p>
        <strong>What types of Cookies do we use and how do we use them?</strong>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        The types of first and third-party cookies we serve through our Websites
        include, without limitation:
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Essential website cookies</strong>: Cookies that are strictly
        necessary to provide services available through our Websites and to use some
        of its features, such as accessing secure areas.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Performance and functionality cookies</strong>: Cookies used to
        enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are
        non-essential to their use. Without these cookies, however, certain
        functionality may become unavailable.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Analytics and customization cookies</strong>: Cookies that collect
        information in either aggregate form to help us customize Websites for each
        visitor, identify how visitors use those Websites, and gauge the effectiveness
        of our marketing campaigns.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Advertising cookies</strong>: Cookies that help make advertising
        messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same
        ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring ads are properly displayed, and
        selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>Social networking cookies</strong>: Cookies that enable you to share
        pages and content on our Websites through third party social networking
        websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>How can you control Cookies?</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        You have the right to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
        preferences by clicking the appropriate links provided on the pop-up banner
        when you land on one of our websites. We will ask you to update or reaffirm
        your choices every 12 months.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Even if you accept cookies initially, you will always have the right to
        withdraw your consent at a later stage. You can also modify your web browser
        controls to accept or refuse cookies entirely at the browser level (this
        setting will apply to all websites you visit).
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        If you choose to reject cookies, you can still use our website, though some
        functionality may be restricted (essentially our website will not remember any
        of your settings or preferences).
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising - you
        will continue to see ads on websites you visit, but they will be generic and
        not tailored to your interests.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        A note on essential website cookies: Because these cookies are strictly
        necessary to deliver the Websites to you (i.e. our Websites would not work if
        these cookies were not sent), you cannot refuse or opt-out of them through our
        Websites. However, you can block or delete them by changing your browser
        settings as described above.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        <strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons? </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track website visitors. We may
        employ a technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help
        us better manage the Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear
        gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
        cookies, that are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast
        to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are
        embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails and are about the size of the
        period at the end of this sentence. We may use clear gifs or pixels in our
        HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
        This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, and the
        effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

        <strong>Do we use targeted advertising? </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">
        For advertising purposes, third parties may serve cookies on your computer or
        mobile device. These companies may use information about your visits to this
        and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services
        you may be interested in. They may also employ technology to measure the
        effectiveness of those advertisements. This can be accomplished with cookies
        or web beacons that collect information about your visits to this and other
        sites. Using that information these companies may be able to identify your
        interests and provide relevant advertisements about goods and services. The
        information collected through this process does not enable us or them to
        identify your name, contact details, or other personally identifying details
        unless you choose to provide these.
