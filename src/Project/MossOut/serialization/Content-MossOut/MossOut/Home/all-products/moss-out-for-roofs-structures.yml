            <p><strong>FOR BEST RESULTS:</strong> Apply this product just prior to the time when fall rains begin or in early spring. Moss growth can occur in nearly any location where dampness persists; such areas include roofs, patios, sidewalks and foundations. Destroying existing moss is done most effectively during times when its growth is most rapid and when rain is not expected for several days. </p>
        <strong>
        PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: </strong><br />
        <ol>
            <li> This product can be applied directly from container as a powder. Apply at the rate of 4 lbs. to 4,000 sq ft of area.</li>
            <li>To apply as spray, use a sprinkling can or tank sprayer. Slowly add 4 lbs of this product to 13 <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> gallons of water (1 lb. to 3 <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> gallons), stirring continuously. Spray to thoroughly wet surface, using 1 gallon of mixture to 300 sq. ft. of area.  NOTE: Do not mix more product than you can use at one time. Do not store mixed solution in tank sprayer or sprinkling can. Damage may occur.</li>
            <li>Repeat treatment as necessary (when new moss growth begins to appear).</li>
        </ol>
        Refer to product label for destruction of heavy moss growth.
