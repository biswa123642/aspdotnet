            <p><strong>To Spot Treat Moss in Lawns:</strong><br />
        <strong>
        PREPARE THE LAWN:</strong> Apply anytime the lawn is moist and moss is actively growing. Treatment in fall or early spring is most effective. Mow the lawn to expose moss and remove clippings. </p>
        <p><strong>TREAT THE MOSS:</strong> For spot treatment, sprinkle granules over mossy areas in lawn. Use diagram as a guide for application rate. This container will treat up to 600 sq. ft of lawn. Immediately after sprinkling granules, water treated areas thoroughly. A gentle rain, even immediately after spot treatment will not significantly affect the moss-killing ability of this product. Wait several days until moss turns black and dies, then gently rake it out.</p>
        <p><strong>To Spot Treat Moss Around Ornamental Shrubs &amp; Flower Beds:</strong><br />
        Apply anytime moss is actively growing and the soil is moist. Sprinkle granules over mossy areas. See diagram for application rate. Immediately after sprinkling granules, water treated areas thoroughly. Wait several days then gently rake out dead moss.</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This product will burn foliage if applied directly to flowers or ornamental shrubs. If contact occurs, use a hose to wash this product off these plants right away. </p>
