        <p>Chet Selis grew up in Northeast Portland with cats in his home. After he graduated from college in Seattle, he felt it was the right time to adopt a furry companion of his very own. At the Seattle Humane Society, he noticed a pint-sized black cat with bright green eyes.</p> <p>"She was really cute, and her eyes were pretty," says Selis.</p> <p>The playful and affectionate kitten, who Selis named Spark, seemed to have boundless energy, which she still displays now that she's fully grown. She bats toys on the ground and trots around the house while carrying the toy proudly in her mouth. "She also loves stairs. She runs up and down them at a full sprint. She rolls around and stretches out, and she loves belly rubs," he says.</p> <p>He moved with Spark several times in the last few years, and she was introduced to different roommates and pets each time. Some moves have gone better than others. Last year, there was a female cat in the household that didn't get along with Spark; she would run at Spark to intimidate her. Instead of standing her ground or challenging her, Spark would run away. "She [Spark] was scared of her. They did not get along at all. "</p> <p>Ten months ago, Selis moved back to his hometown of Portland, Oregon. Selis says Spark adapted relatively well to her new townhouse digs and roommates, including an outdoor cat named Malcolm.  They don't fight like Spark and the female cat did, and Selis is grateful for the change.</p> <p>Selis is the operations manager at the Portland peer-to-peer laundry service, Loopie. "Working at a startup is very stressful compared to other jobs I've had in the past."</p> <p>Selis says he's noticed Spark has become more timid and jumpy over the years, especially where there are changes in her environment, like new people coming to the house. Spark's behaviors worsen when Selis has been away for long periods or has <a target="_blank" href="~/link.aspx?_id=cd9c0ac781e64cc4ba224595d0291eaf&amp;_z=z" class="editor-rtfLink">multiple busy days at work</a>. He says she increasingly acts out. <a target="_blank" href="~/link.aspx?_id=c0f79c1cef05476fbf2c52f3e2e22748&amp;_z=z" class="editor-rtfLink">Spark's stressed-out symptoms</a> include peeing on the bed and scratching the couch in the living room.</p> <p>Selis began using the <a target="_blank" href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z" class="editor-rtfLink">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a>. The collar mimics the pheromones a cat releases to indicate the area is safe and secure. (It's kind of like sending a signal in the cat's language to let her know she's safe and can relax.)</p> <p>While Spark still runs and hides when new people ring the doorbell, Selis noticed Spark was more content and calm after just a week of using the collar. She purrs more and seems to luxuriate in her relaxation time, rolling around on the floor in bliss. He enjoys seeing her in her happy places, like sitting by a window quizzically looking outside with her head cocked to one side. Selis thinks it's imperative to pay attention to a cat's emotional wellbeing. "It's harder to notice if there's something mental versus something physical, but it's equally important," he says.</p> <p>Selis says having a cat helps with his stress as well. "Coming home after a crazy day to little Spark is the best thing. Just having that outlet not to think about me and think about someone else helps take my mind off of the crazy stuff that has happened."</p> <p>With the help of Comfort Zone products, Spark is likely to be found lounging high up on her cat tower near the kitchen or making the stair sprints she loves so well. Spark is happy and content and is the more confident "spark plug" Selis fell in love with in the first place.</p>
