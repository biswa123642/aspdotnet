        <p>If you're looking for gifts for your cat-obsessed friend, then you've come to the right place. Cat gifts can be a great way to show your friend you genuinely care about her and her precious fur baby, whether you're celebrating a holiday or looking for cat birthday gifts. From calendars to gift baskets to T-shirts and treats, these gifts for cat owners are sure to make your friend smile and your friend's cat purr with joy.</p> <h2>1. Custom Cat Calendars</h2> <p>If you are extra crafty, you might enjoy designing and creating a custom cat calendar. It can be as simple as making a yearly calendar where each month features a different picture of your friend's cat.</p> <p>Or you can make a calendar that counts down to a special day in your friend or his cat's life. Maybe it's counting down to Christmas like the traditional Advent calendar. Or maybe it's counting down to the cat's birthday or adoption day.</p> <p>To create these unique calendars, use very small paper bags in different colors, each filled with a cat treat. Fold the bags in different sizes, tape them closed in the back, put bows on the front of each, and put numbers on the bags. Attach the bags to a piece of wood or poster board, and you have an easy-to-make but very cute and tasty cat calendar.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;You might even add cat stickers to the front of the bags for extra decoration.</p> <img alt="cat advent calendar" src="-/media/BD13D7CF18ED487197E1F8CEA425003C.ashx?h=267&amp;w=400" />&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>2. Purrrfectly Calm Cat Gift Basket</h2> <p>You can also opt to make a calming cat gift basket for your friend. Fill the basket with items to help your friend's cat relax. Think of it as a cat spa day! It can include treats, a soft blanket for snuggling, a toy filled with catnip, cat wipes or a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/all-products/grooming-care/shampoos-and-conditioners/magic-coat-waterless-shampoo-for-cats" target="_blank">waterless shampoo</a>&nbsp;with a soothing scent, and a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.comfortzone.com/all-products/comfort-zone-calming-diffuser" target="_blank">Comfort Zone Calming Diffuser</a>.</p> <p>The calming diffuser releases a drug-free, odorless vapor that mimics the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.comfortzone.com/behavior-blog/pheromones/what-are-cat-pheromones" target="_blank">pheromones</a>&nbsp;a cat releases to indicate an area is safe and secure. This is kind of like sending a signal in a cat's language that lets him know he can relax.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="cat gift basket" src="-/media/F8D4A13AB36D44818BF0BB5D6E771A1B.ashx?h=300&amp;w=400" />&nbsp; <h2>3. Photo Book</h2> <p>Many online sites allow you to load photos and order a hardcover photo book.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Consider making one for your friend's cat. Use photos your friend has shared with you or photos from social media and add in some fun memories of your own. You might want to highlight the cat's birthday, photos from when she was a kitten, photos with your friend's children, cute quotes, and photos with other pets. Your friend will be touched that you went through so much effort.</p> <img alt="woman taking cell phone photo with cat" src="-/media/615D9F599E534DDC8CDC0D1094127C47.ashx?h=267&amp;w=400" />&nbsp; <h2></h2> <h2>4. Cat Travel Kit</h2> <p>Is your friend nervous about<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://" target="_blank">traveling with his cat</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://" target="_blank">?</a> Put together a "travel kit."

Personalized Framed Picture</h2> <p>If your friend has a particularly adorable photo of her cat, then why not put it in a really cute frame? You can get a thick frame and decorate it with all sorts of cat symbols, like pendants in the shape of paw prints and cats, cat stickers, fish, and a cute saying stenciled on the frame like "nine lives," "fur baby," or "purrfect."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><img alt="cat photos for frame" src="-/media/C1553B1051E4410C9F06BF0A8D9A9CF6.ashx?h=267&amp;w=400" /></h2> <h2>6. Cat T-Shirts</h2> <p>Another cute idea is to make your friend a T-shirt with his cat's face on the front. Numerous T-shirt printing companies will let you send in a photo that can be put on the front of the T-shirt with the cat's name under it. Try adding a cute saying like "Purrfect Day" or "I love my cat." If you want to do more of the work yourself, you can buy an iron-on T-shirt print and make the shirt at home.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="I love my cat quote and cat image" src="-/media/AC64AAA908004C1FA0A3707C7E7B6227.ashx?h=249&amp;w=400" /></p> <h2>7. Homemade Cat Treats</h2> <p>If you're especially good at baking, why not try your hand at homemade cat treats?<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Present them in a cute mason jar tied with a ribbon.</p> <img height="420" alt="gift jars of cat treats" width="400" src="-/media/2E432201B1344324817C8D3ACBB77FB7.ashx" />&nbsp; <p>There's no end to ideas for purrrfect gifts for your cat-loving friends.
