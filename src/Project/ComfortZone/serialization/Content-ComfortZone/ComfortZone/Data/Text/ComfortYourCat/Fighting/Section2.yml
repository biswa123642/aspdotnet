        <h2>INCREASING CONFIDENCE CAN DECREASE FIGHTING</h2>
        <p>You may think confident cats will act out more frequently, but the opposite is actually true. When a cat is insecure, she'll overcompensate&mdash;often by fighting. That's why it's important to build your cats' confidence. Give them high spaces they can flee to so they never feel cornered, like cat trees and window perches. Give them multiple cat beds, food and water bowls, and litter boxes, so they don't fight over resources. Play with them frequently every day, so they feel bonded with you and aren't jealous of each other. In more challenging cases, you might even <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1ef6c456489246f39fb1de05b94656b0&amp;_z=z">have to reintroduce them</a> to each other and create a blank slate to build upon.</p>
