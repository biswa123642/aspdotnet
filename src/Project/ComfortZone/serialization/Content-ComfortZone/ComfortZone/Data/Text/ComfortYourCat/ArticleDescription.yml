        <p>Do you know your cat's stress signs? Our fur babies aren't very vocal about their frustration, but they are trying to communicate&mdash;we just need to learn their language. Some signs of stress may include scratching destructively on your carpet or marking on your furniture.</p>
        <p>Once you know your cat is stressed, try finding and reducing the triggers. Cats can get stressed over the smallest changes. A stray cat outside, a new couch, not having enough litter boxes or even feeling bored can send your kitty into a tailspin.</p>
        <p>The solutions might be simple. If your cats are fighting, you might need to reintroduce them slowly. You may need to add extra litter boxes. Helping your cat gain confidence can also reduce stress. Play with him more. Give him tall cat trees to climb.</p>
        <p>Above all, Comfort Zone products can be your secret weapon to help reduce stress. They mimic your cat's natural calming pheromones, signaling that everything's OK. Use the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=95006831e2d2472bb25290d4651f0ce4&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Cat Calming Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> in rooms where your cat spends the most time, or the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=948286a0bbfe48f589225c83c2b22f6f&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Multi-Cat Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> if you have more than one cat. If your cat is on the go, try the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a> instead, so the calming notes are with him whether he's indoors or outside. And the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe5c74b03b2d4f90abd26c476ff8623d&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a> can be used to help control scratching on specific items, like your sofa table.</p>
        <p>Below are six signs that may reveal your cat is stressed and what you can do to help with each specific issue.</p>
