        <h2>CREATE POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS</h2>
        <p>You shouldn't force a shy cat out of hiding because that could make things worse. But there are many things you can do to coax her out. Sit near your cat and talk calmly. Lay a few  extra-fragrant treats nearby. Tempt her with a toy she can chase. When she does venture out, extend your hand and let her sniff it first. Give her space to explore and "mark" your home with head bumps<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=211c96a6e465408788bd145cc109140d&amp;_z=z"></a>, so your place smells more like her.<sup>1</sup> Leave room doors open, set up cat trees, and have other "escape routes" for her. She'll be more likely to explore if it's easy to get back to where she feels safest.</p>
