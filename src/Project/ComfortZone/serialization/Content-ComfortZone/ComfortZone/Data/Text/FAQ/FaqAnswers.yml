        <a id="pheromones" class="score-anchorpoint" name="pheromones">Pheromones</a>
        <h2>Pheromones</h2>
        <h4>WHAT IS A PHEROMONE?</h4>
        <p>Pheromones are scents that cats (and other animals) use to communicate with one another. Comfort Zone diffusers release pheromones that mimic a cat&rsquo;s natural, calming pheromones, signaling to them that an area is safe and friendly, putting them at ease.</p>
        <h4>DO THE COMFORT ZONE PHEROMONES AFFECT PEOPLE OR OTHER ANIMALS IN MY HOUSE?</h4>
        <p>We have no evidence it affects people or other animals.</p>
        <h4>WILL THE COMFORT ZONE PHEROMONES SEDATE MY CAT?</h4>
        <p>Comfort Zone diffusers are drug-free and release odorless pheromones that calm your cat and should have no sedative effects.</p>
        <h4>ARE THERE ANY ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE COMFORT ZONE PHEROMONES THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?</h4>
        <p>We have no evidence of any adverse side effects.</p>
        <h4>WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS?</h4>
        <p>Pheromones are a mixture of fatty acids. Our products also contain a solvent, which helps dissolve the pheromones so it can be sprayed or diffused.</p>
        <a id="diffuser" class="score-anchorpoint" name="diffuser">Diffuser</a>
        <h2>Diffuser</h2>
        <h4>HOW ARE YOUR PRODUCTS PROVEN TO WORK?</h4>
        <p>We use a combination of laboratory studies and in-home tests to prove that our products work.</p>
        <h4>HOW LONG DO THE DIFFUSER REFILLS LAST?</h4>
        <p>Refills last up to 30 days.</p>
        <h4>IS IT NORMAL FOR THE DIFFUSER TO FEEL HOT?</h4>
        <p>This is totally normal, as heat is required to disperse pheromones into the air. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed.</p>
        <h4>WHAT IS "NEW AND IMPROVED" ABOUT THE PRODUCT?</h4>
        <p>Comfort Zone products are known for their effective pheromone technology, and now we&rsquo;ve improved the diffuser system as well, providing a longer-lasting, consistent diffusion of pheromones for up to 30 days.</p>
        <h4>WILL THE OLD REFILLS WORK IN THE NEW DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>Yes, but we don&rsquo;t recommend mixing these.</p>
        <h4>WILL THE OLD REFILLS WORK IN THE NEW DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>Yes, but we don&rsquo;t recommend mixing these.</p>
        <h4>WILL OTHER BRANDS' REFILLS WORK IN YOUR DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>No, we recommend using only Comfort Zone brand refills with our diffusers.</p>
        <h4>HOW LARGE OF AN AREA DOES ONE DIFFUSER COVER?</h4>
        <p>One large room per diffuser, up to 400 square feet.</p>
        <h4>WHEN SHOULD I CHANGE OUT THE DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>We recommend that you change the diffuser once every year.</p>
        <h4>WHERE DO I PLUG THE DIFFUSER IN?</h4>
        <p>Plug it into any standard household outlet, which are typically 15 or 20 amps. Be sure to keep the diffuser away from obstructions, like furniture, and away from open windows.</p>
        <h4>WHAT VOLTAGE OUTLET WORKS FOR MY DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>120V, the standard for outlets in the USA and Canada.</p>
        <h4>I NOTICED A SMELL FROM THE DIFFUSER. IS THAT NORMAL?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely. Some people with a sensitive sense of smell may perceive a slight oily scent from the diffuser.</p>
        <h4>IS IT OK TO USE THE ROTATING PLUG ON A POWER STRIP?</h4>
        <p>No, the product will not function properly.</p>
        <h4>IS IT OK TO USE THIS PRODUCT INTERMITTENTLY?</h4>
        <p>No, the product will not function properly and will stop working.</p>
        <h4>CAN I USE THE COMFORT ZONE REFILLS WITH OTHER DIFFUSERS?</h4>
        <p>No. We recommend using the refills with only the Comfort Zone diffusers.</p>
        <h4>CAN I USE THE CALMING REFILL IN THE MULTI-CAT DIFFUSER, AND VICE-VERSA?</h4>
        <p>Yes, as long as they&rsquo;re both Comfort Zone products.</p>
        <h4>HOW DO I KNOW THE DIFFUSER IS WORKING?</h4>
        <p>It normally takes up to a week to see results in your cat&rsquo;s behavior. After that, you should gradually see your cat reduce stressful behaviors over time.</p>
        <h4>CAN THE DIFFUSER BE USED AROUND OPEN WINDOWS?</h4>
        <p>We recommend not using the diffuser unit in a room with open windows or near vents. If it has to be in a room with open windows or vents, put it on the opposite wall to ensure the refill lasts up to 30 days. If you use the diffuser around an open window, the product is less likely to be effective.</p>
        <h4>CAN I USE THE DIFFUSER IF MY OUTLET IS HORIZONTAL?</h4>
        <p>Yes, just turn the diffuser so that the refill reservoir is always at the lowest point.</p>
        <h4>SHOULD THE DIFFUSER BE PLUGGED IN ALL DAY?</h4>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h4>SHOULD I BUY THE CALMING DIFFUSER OR THE MULTI-CAT DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re looking to solve multi-cat tension and conflict issues, try our Multi-Cat Diffuser. If your primary goal is to stop scratching and/or urine spraying, use our Calming Diffuser.</p>
        <h4>MY CAT IS SCRATCHING. HOW SHOULD I USE THE DIFFUSER?</h4>
        <p>Use one per room where the cat spends the most time, and allow 2-4 days to start seeing results.</p>
        <h4>SHOULD BOTH THE COMFORT ZONE DIFFUSER AND SPRAY BE USED TOGETHER FOR BETTER RESULTS?</h4>
        <p>We recommend using the spray to &ldquo;spot treat&rdquo; areas where your cat has sprayed or scratched, and to use the diffuser as an always-on solution.</p>
        <h4>WILL THE DIFFUSER STOP MY CAT FROM URINATING OUTSIDE THE LITTER BOX AND/OR MARKING AROUND THE HOUSE?</h4>
        <p>Cats spray for a variety of reasons, but if your cat is spraying due to stress and not illness, it&rsquo;s proven 95% effective at reducing urine marking.</p>
        <a id="spray" class="score-anchorpoint" name="spray">Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a>
        <h2>Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</h2>
        <h4>WILL THE SPRAY STAIN?</h4>
        <p>We tested the spray on many common household fabrics and surfaces, and found no evidence of staining. Spray a small area first before applying a lot of product to be sure.</p>
        <h4>HOW SHOULD I USE THE SPRAY FOR TRAVEL?</h4>
        <p>Spray five times onto your cat&rsquo;s travel bedding or in the carrier before travel to help reduce their stress.</p>
        <h4>HOW LONG DO THE EFFECTS OF THE SPRAY LAST?</h4>
        <p>The spray lasts several hours.</p>
        <h4>CAN I USE THE SPRAY WITH CLEANER/ENZYME?</h4>
        <p>Yes, we recommend using an enzyme based urine cleaner first, and once dry, use the Comfort Zone Calming Spray to help manage urine marking.</p>
