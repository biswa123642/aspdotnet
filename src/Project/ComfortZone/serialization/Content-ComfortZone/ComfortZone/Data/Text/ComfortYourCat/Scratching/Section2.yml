        <h2>HOW TO HELP YOUR CAT SCRATCH LESS DESTRUCTIVELY</h2>
        <p>You can help decrease scratching by building your cat's confidence.<sup>2</sup> Provide your cat with more "territory" to call his own, like cat trees and window perches.

A bored cat with too much energy can be more destructive, so help him get that energy out in positive ways. Don't forget to provide enticing alternatives to scratch.

Some indoor-only cats might also need a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3b74412b1bdf4af99dada2306e44432f&amp;_z=z">nail trim</a>.</p>
