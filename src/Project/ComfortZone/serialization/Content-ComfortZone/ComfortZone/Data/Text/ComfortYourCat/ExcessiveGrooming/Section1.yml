        <h2>REDUCING STRESS CAN HELP MINIMIZE OVERGROOMING</h2>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0c64d4cb613742438d6fa00ff32f033b&amp;_z=z">Stress</a>, whether caused by the environment or a health issue, is a cause of overgrooming. Your cat feels comforted when she licks herself, so she may groom more if she's stressed. First, take your kitty to the veterinarian for a checkup. If she gets a clean bill of health, then look for stressors that could trigger overgrooming. These could be wide-ranging, like another pet <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1ef6c456489246f39fb1de05b94656b0&amp;_z=z">intimidating your cat</a>, moving the litter box, rearranging the furniture, or even a schedule change that <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=a784cdbe47af42b793a02ffa34acb00d&amp;_z=z">left your cat feeling lonely.</a> Try solutions that address the trigger directly, like reintroducing pets that aren't getting along. Or take a shirt worn by the person your cat misses and leave it near your cat's bed. Maintain your routines as much as possible, so new triggers don't develop.</p>
