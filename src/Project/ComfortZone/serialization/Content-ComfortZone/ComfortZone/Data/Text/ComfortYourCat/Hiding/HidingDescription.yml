        <p>You might feel a little sad if you notice your cat is hiding and acting weird. But don't take your kitty's actions personally. Sometimes cats hide because they need a place to rest away from noise and activity. But <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1c34c14596bd447b9e42f9b2f8b16aba&amp;_z=z">if your cat is hiding all the time</a>, that's different. He's likely feeling insecure because of changes in his environment. If you want to get a scared cat out of hiding, you need to build his confidence with a lot of love and patience.</p>
