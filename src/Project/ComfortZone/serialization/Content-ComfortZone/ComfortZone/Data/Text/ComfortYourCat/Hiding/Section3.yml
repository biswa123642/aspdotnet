        <h2>COMFORT ZONE PRODUCTS CAN HELP</h2>
        <p>Comfort Zone products can help your kitty's e-meow-tional health, so she's more likely to venture out. These are designed to mimic <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=211c96a6e465408788bd145cc109140d&amp;_z=z">a cat's natural pheromones</a>, helping manage stress. Set up a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=95006831e2d2472bb25290d4651f0ce4&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Cat Calming Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> in each room where she spends the most time. Or, give her a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a>, so the calming signals are with her whether she's hiding or exploring. If you have more than one cat, try the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=948286a0bbfe48f589225c83c2b22f6f&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Multi-Cat Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a>. If your cat is hiding or avoiding a specific area in the house, spray the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe5c74b03b2d4f90abd26c476ff8623d&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a> to help create a calming environment.</p>
        <p>If your cat's hiding, she could be reacting to a new source of stress. While you're figuring out the triggers, help her build her confidence. Before long, she'll be having all sorts of adventures again.</p>
