        <p>Nothing gets in the way of a loving relationship with your cat like their unwanted behaviors, including scratching, spraying and fighting.</p>
        <p>Many cat owners turn to social media for tips and advice to help solve pet behavior problems. That&rsquo;s how we found Jessaline and Annie, who were both living with these unwanted behaviors, and asked them to try new and improved Comfort Zone products for 30 days and tell us about their results.</p>
        <p>These are real people &mdash; and real cats &mdash; who used our Calming diffusers to create harmony in their homes.</p>
