        <h2>TRY COMFORT ZONE TO CALM YOUR CAT</h2>
        <p>Comfort Zone Calming Diffusers can help reduce stress. While we often focus on a cat's physical health, her e-meow-tional health is just as important. Comfort Zone products are designed to help cats feel safe, happy, and calm by using signals they understand. Place a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=95006831e2d2472bb25290d4651f0ce4&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> in each room where your cat spends the most time. If you have more than one cat, use the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=948286a0bbfe48f589225c83c2b22f6f&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Multi-Cat Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a>. If your cat has more space to roam, put on a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a>, so the calming notes are with her no matter where she is. And don't forget to spray <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe5c74b03b2d4f90abd26c476ff8623d&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a> once a day on areas where you don't want her to scratch. The effects of the spray last for several hours.</p>
        <p>Scratching is perfectly natural, but it can get destructive if your cat is stressed or doesn't have a more enticing alternative. By following these steps, you can help your kitty move on from his bad scratching habits and help him feel calm and relaxed.</p>
