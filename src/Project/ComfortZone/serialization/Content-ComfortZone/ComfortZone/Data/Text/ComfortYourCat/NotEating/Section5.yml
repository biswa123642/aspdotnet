        <h2>MINIMIZE STRESS WITH COMFORT ZONE PRODUCTS</h2>
        <p>As you help your cat with environmental adjustments, support his e-meow-tional health. Comfort Zone products can help your cat manage stress by promoting relaxation and emotional balance. By mimicking <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=211c96a6e465408788bd145cc109140d&amp;_z=z">your cat's natural pheromones</a>, these products signal in his language that everything's okay. Plug a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=95006831e2d2472bb25290d4651f0ce4&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Cat Calming Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> into the rooms where your cat spends the most time, or use the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=948286a0bbfe48f589225c83c2b22f6f&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Multi-Cat Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> if you have more than one cat. You could choose to put a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a> on him, so the calming notes are with him no matter where he is. Since scratching and spraying are stress signs, you might need the help of the  <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe5c74b03b2d4f90abd26c476ff8623d&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a> too.</p>
        <p>Stress can be a serious issue for your kitty. Once you've ruled out health issues, look around your home and at your routine for things that may be causing your cat stress. Changing the environment can help your cat feel more comfortable. And Comfort Zone products can help you support your cat's e-meow-tional health.</p>
