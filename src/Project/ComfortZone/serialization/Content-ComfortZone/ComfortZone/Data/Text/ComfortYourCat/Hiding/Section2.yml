        <h2>LOOK FOR TRIGGERS</h2>
        <p>Look for triggers that might scare your cat, whether it's a loud appliance, a ringing doorbell, other family members, or another pet.<sup>2</sup> <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=bea359dc11574bb5bbf193c5fb165002&amp;_z=z">Teach your dog not to chase your cat</a> if that happens. If you have two cats that sometimes fight, consider <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1ef6c456489246f39fb1de05b94656b0&amp;_z=z">reintroducing them</a>. Even moving too quickly can trigger the hiding behavior. While you look for triggers, make sure you boost your cat's confidence. Set up window perches and other high spaces where your cat can feel safe. Give him territory all his own, like cat beds, litter boxes, and toys. Play with him to build your bond. The closer you and your cat are, the more confident he'll feel.</p>
