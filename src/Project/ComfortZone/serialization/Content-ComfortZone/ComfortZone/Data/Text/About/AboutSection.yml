        <p>Pets make life better. We want to celebrate and maintain the benefits of having pets, but as pet owners, we know that it&rsquo;s not always easy. Cats and dogs are sensitive creatures and can be easily stressed. When pets experience stress, they often act out in ways that are concerning and sometimes disruptive.</p>

We work hard at developing and manufacturing products that perform to high standards of efficacy, making sure our products are proven to reduce stress behaviors in cats and dogs.</p>
