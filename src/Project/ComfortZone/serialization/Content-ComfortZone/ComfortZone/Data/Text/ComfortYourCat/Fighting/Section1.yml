        <h2>CATS FIGHT BECAUSE OF INSECURITIES</h2>
        <p>Cats fight each other for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the fighting is due to insecurity. One cat may feel like his territory is being infringed upon, or he may feel like the other cat is a threat. If they used to get along and now <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=90f234c654474f57bc26f274bace511d&amp;_z=z">they're suddenly fighting</a>, it could be because one smells different due to a recent vet visit or outdoor journey. Or one cat might have been startled by a sudden noise, and he now associates that with your other cat. If one cat's personality has suddenly changed, take your kitty to the veterinarian to rule out any health issues.</p>
