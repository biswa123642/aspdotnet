        <h2>CHANGE UP HIS MEALTIME ROUTINE</h2>
        <p>Make mealtime more enticing for your kitty. If your food's expired or if your cat's tired of the flavor or texture, she might turn her nose up at dinner. Also, be sure to check online to see if your cat's food has been recalled.</p>
        <p>If your kitty is just bored with what she's been eating, try mixing a new flavor of food with the old one or tempt your cat with extra-fragrant wet cat food. You might try experimenting with different textures or flavors. Or, you could try making your kitty dinner from scratch&mdash;just check with your veterinarian to make sure your homemade recipe is nutritionally balanced.</p>
        <p>It's also possible your cat has developed a food sensitivity or allergy. Talk with your veterinarian if you think this could be the case.</p>
        <p>A sudden shift in food can make your cat's stomach upset, so make these changes slowly. If you've been serving your cat refrigerated, canned food, warm it up a little before serving it. Use treats to entice her. Try making mealtime a game and toss individual kibbles down the hall so she can "hunt" them like prey. Interactive feeder toys can also help.</p>
