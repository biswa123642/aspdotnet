        <h2>STRESS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LITTER ISSUES</h2>
        <p>Sometimes litter box issues are triggered by stress. If a stray cat is wandering outside at night, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=99d447aa412e40e2ae5326c13880479b&amp;_z=z">your cat might start spraying</a> to mark her territory. If you recently <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=24fd405c35cf4178b85ea078c70a4992&amp;_z=z">adopted a new cat</a>, your first cat might pee outside the box because she's intimidated and needs a box she doesn't have to share. A good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat plus one extra litter box in your home.</p>
        <p>Even rearranging furniture or leaving home more often can trigger insecurity in your kitty. Set up cat trees  or cat condos in your home since cats tend to feel more confident when they have high spaces to inhabit. Play with your kitty more and try <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=d7d9cec2ec8e4db3bad1347f4c452312&amp;_z=z">clicker training</a>. The more you bond with your cat, the more confident she'll feel.</p>
