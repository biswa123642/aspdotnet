        <h2>CHECK YOUR CAT'S HEALTH AND LITTER BOX PREFERENCE</h2>
        <p>If your cat's peeing habits have changed, take him to a veterinarian right away. Peeing outside a litter box&mdash;whether just over the edge or all over your house&mdash;can be a sign of health issues.</p>
        <p>Once your cat has a clean bill of health, try different types of boxes and litter.<sup>1</sup> Sometimes, cats develop a particular preference for reasons we may not clearly understand. He might feel a box is too big, or he might be intimidated if a box is in an area with a lot of noise. He may be picky about the type of litter, preferring clay over pellets or wanting crystals, so dust doesn't get stuck in his paws. Some cats dislike the fragrance of the litter or prefer it to be a certain depth. Test a variety of boxes and litter types to determine your cat's preferences. Make sure you clean the litter boxes frequently. Cats will find other places to use as a litter box if theirs isn't clean.</p>
