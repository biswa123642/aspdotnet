        <h2>LOOK AROUND THE HOME</h2>
        <p> Once you get a clean bill of health, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0c64d4cb613742438d6fa00ff32f033b&amp;_z=z">look for stressors around your home</a> that might contribute to his appetite loss. Did you recently redecorate a room in your home? Did you recently <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=c8b19ea99225424dbf0a375a38365f40&amp;_z=z">move</a>? Has your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=cd9c0ac781e64cc4ba224595d0291eaf&amp;_z=z">work schedule</a> changed? Where is your cat's food bowl? Is it in an area that suddenly has more traffic? You might consider walking through the rooms in your  house where your cat hangs out the most and look at it from his point of view. Think about your normal routine and look for things that may have changed. Sometimes even the smallest trigger is enough to cause your kitty stress, and you may need to make a few changes to help remove the trigger.</p>
