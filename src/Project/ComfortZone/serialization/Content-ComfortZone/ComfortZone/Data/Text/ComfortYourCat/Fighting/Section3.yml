        <h2>COMFORT ZONE PRODUCTS CAN HELP</h2>
        <p>If your cats are fighting each other a lot, Comfort Zone products can help. They promote a calming effect, signaling in your cat's language that everything is safe. Plug a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=948286a0bbfe48f589225c83c2b22f6f&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Multi-Cat Diffuser with Opticalm Diffuser</a> into the rooms where your cats spend the most time to help reduce the stress that leads to multi-cat tension. If you feel one cat is particularly stressed, put a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0bb91a24b1a0477a9acf3f8da032ea83&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Calming Pheromone Collar</a> on him, so the calming signals go with him wherever he roams. If there are any places where they pee or scratch to claim their territory, spray the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=fe5c74b03b2d4f90abd26c476ff8623d&amp;_z=z">Comfort Zone Spray &amp; Scratch Control Spray</a> on those areas once a day. These products help your cats' e-meow-tional health, which is just as important as their physical health.</p>
        <p>If your cats are fighting with each other, there are several things you can do to help bring peace back to the home. By giving them more territory, playing with them more often, and providing calming Comfort Zone products, you can help increase your cats' confidence and cut down on unwanted cat fights.</p>
