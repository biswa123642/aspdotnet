        <h2>SOMETIMES BOREDOM CONTRIBUTES TO OVERGROOMING</h2>
        <p>Sometimes a bored cat will start overgrooming because he doesn't have enough mental stimulation.<sup>1</sup> In those cases, there's a lot you can do to help your kitty. Start playing with him every day, getting him to chase you around the house. You can use a feather wand toy or even hold a treat in your hand and entice him to run. Try using an automated toy that works during the day while you're gone. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=d7d9cec2ec8e4db3bad1347f4c452312&amp;_z=z">Clicker train him</a> and teach him tricks, eventually building up to homemade obstacle courses. Get a cat harness and leash and take him outside in your yard. Open your window shades and put a bird feeder outside the window. These are some tried-and-true methods that can help a bored cat.</p>
