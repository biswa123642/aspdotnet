      Value: "<br /><p> If you&rsquo;re one of the many people who want to give your male dog a name that&rsquo;s perfect for the modern age, look no further. Here are the top ten names for male dogs, sourced from Rover.com. Which one fits your dog best? </p><h2> #1: Max </h2><p> This perennial favorite among dog owners means &ldquo;the greatest&rdquo; and so is the perfect choice if your guy is indeed the greatest! It was originally a diminutive of Maxwell or Maximilian. This is an ideal name for any serious, tough German breed of dog, particularly if the dog smokes cigars. It will also work for a Chihuahua, however. </p><h2> #2: Charlie </h2><p> This is a nickname for Charles, and it means &ldquo;free.&rdquo; In the human world we have Charlie Parker, Charlie Chaplin, and so on. This is a great name to give a happy, friendly, free-spirited dog such as, well, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. If you have a more serious dog, consider the original, but if you have the nerve, consider the greatest Charles of all&mdash;Charlemagne. </p><h2> #3: Buddy </h2><p> This is one of the few popular dog names that doesn&rsquo;t have much of a human counterpart. Don&rsquo;t mention Buddy Holly&mdash;his real name was Charles. This name may actually have derived from a baby&rsquo;s inability to say &ldquo;brother&rdquo; properly, but it&rsquo;s uncertain. This is a suitable name for a real pal, like a Labrador Retriever or a Boxer. </p><h2> #4: Cooper </h2><p> The name means &ldquo;barrel maker&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s kind of hard to apply to a dog. However, there aren&rsquo;t many barrel makers among humans these days, either, but it hasn&rsquo;t stopped people. Bradley Cooper and Anderson Cooper may have had a hand in this. Cooper is a very popular human name in Australia, so it might be perfect for an Australian Shepherd. </p><h2> #5: Jack </h2><p> Even if you don&rsquo;t have a Jack Russell Terrier, Jack remains a strong and popular choice for dogs. In people it&rsquo;s a nickname for John, which means &ldquo;God is gracious&rdquo; in Hebrew. Jack is the number-one human name in Ireland and Scotland and number two in England, so you might think about this name for any dog whose ancestry comes from the British Isles. </p><h2> #6: Rocky </h2><p> If even Jack or Buddy isn&rsquo;t a tough enough name for you, you can come out swinging and try for Rocky, as in Balboa or Marciano. It&rsquo;s a diminutive of the Italian Rocco (which means &ldquo;rest&rdquo;), but most people think about actual rocks in connection with the name. This is definitely a tough guy name suitable for pitbulls, Rottweilers, and Yorkshire Terriers. </p><h2> #7: Toby </h2><p> Toby is short for Tobias (meaning &ldquo;God is good&rdquo;), so if you like the former but want to stand out from the crowd, consider the latter. This is a friendly, unassuming name that is quite suitable for most dogs. If you had two dogs, you could play around with &ldquo;Toby&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Toby&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s a stretcher unless you&rsquo;re a huge Shakespeare fan! </p><h2> #8: Duke </h2><p> John &ldquo;Duke&rdquo; Wayne and Duke Ellington may have something to do with the resurging popularity of this name among humans, but it&rsquo;s always been a bestseller for dogs. If your dog is a noble one, like the Great Dane, consider this choice. </p><h2> #9: Bear </h2><p> Blame Bear Grylls (whose name is really Edward) and coach Bear Bryant if you&rsquo;d like, but suddenly this perennial dog&rsquo;s name&mdash;typically given to large, lumbering breeds like the Newfoundland&mdash;has suddenly become cool among some people. It&rsquo;s still a fine name for a dog though. </p><h2> #10: Tucker </h2><p> A tucker is a fabric pleater, a task at which most dogs don&rsquo;t excel. It&rsquo;s a preppy name, though, with a friendly twist. It&rsquo;s great for Beagles. </p><p> <strong>Diane Morgan</strong> is a pet care expert in Williamsport, Maryland, who has authored numerous books on dog care and nutrition, and has also written many dog breed and horse books. </p> "
