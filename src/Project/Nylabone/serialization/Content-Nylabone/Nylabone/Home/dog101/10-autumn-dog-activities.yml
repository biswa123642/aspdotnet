      Value: "<br /><p>Fall is a great time to bond with your pup. The beautiful autumn foliage and cool weather make for plenty of opportunities for outdoor playtime. Take advantage of these last few weeks before the weather turns to cold with these festive, pet-friendly fall activities!</p> <h2> #1: GO ON A GHOST TOUR</h2> <p>Nothing says Halloween like a spooky adventure. Check your area for pet-friendly tours of haunted locations and bring your fur kid along! You’ll be surprised how many ghost stories and urban legends there are in your area—you’ll learn something new about your neighborhood, and your dog will get some great exercise!</p> <h2>#2: TAKE A HIKE</h2> <p>With the heat of summer dying down and brisk winter on its way, autumn is the perfect time to take a scenic nature walk with your dog. Enjoy all the colors and smells autumn has to offer, all while getting in some dog exercise while you still can. Of course, make sure your dog is protected from fleas and ticks, and check his skin after hiking.</p> <h2>#3: ENJOY A HAY RIDE</h2> <p>Does your dog love sticking his head out the window on road trips? He’s sure to love a ride through the farm on a scenic tour. Hay rides provide your pooch with cool air and some quality outdoor time. Ventures like these are great for social dogs. Before you bring Fido on a hay ride, check to see if the farm is pet-friendly. Be sure to keep him on a leash and make sure he is well-behaved.</p> <h2>#4: TAKE A WEEKEND GETAWAY</h2> <p>Fall is the off-season for many vacation destinations. Destination rates are lower and crowds are smaller, giving you and your pup an exciting opportunity to take a little dog trip. There are plenty of dog-friendly hotels, beaches, trails, and campsites. You can even choose a warmer destination for one last taste of summer!</p> <h2>#5: MAKE THE MOST OF GAMEDAY</h2> <p>There’s no shortage of ways to include your dog in the game day fun! Bring him to a tailgate. Play fetch in the park and try to learn some trick plays. Cheer on your favorite team together from the couch. Whatever you do, don’t forget the snacks!&nbsp;</p> <h2>#6: PICK APPLES</h2> <p>Apple picking: The quintessential autumn activity. Bring your pup along for a relaxing walk through a pet-friendly orchard as you and your friends collect apples together. You can even use the apples you pick to make homemade dog treats! Just be sure to follow proper pet etiquette and bring some waste bags in case you need to pick up after your pup.</p> <h2>#7: SNAP SOME DOG PHOTOS</h2> <p>Fall provides some tremendous dog selfie opportunities! Capture your pup playing outside and save them for future memories. If you’re feeling extra creative, try organizing these dog photos into an autumn scrapbook. And don’t forget to share your photos with us on social media! Tag your autumn snapshots with #Nylabone for a chance to be featured on our pages!</p> <h2>#8: TRY A DOG-FRIENDLY WORKOUT</h2> <p>As the weather starts to cool, look for some indoor dog exercise programs. Many gyms offer “doga,” a version of yoga that you and your dog can do together! This is also a great way for both of you to stay in shape throughout the holiday season.</p> <h2>#9: CELEBRATE OKTOBERFEST</h2> <p>Although you should never give your dog alcohol, you can get him in on the Oktoberfest fun! Bring him to an outdoor celebration where pets are welcome. Even better, host your own Oktoberfest party and invite all the dogs in the neighborhood!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>#10: HAVE A HALLOWEEN MOVIE MARATHON</h2> <p>After you’ve spent some time exercising with your fur kid, treat him to some Halloween classics. You don’t have to watch scary movies if your pup gets frightened easily—snuggle up to family-friendly Halloween films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, and It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. This is also a good activity for dogs who don’t like the excitement of trick-or-treaters. Simply leave a bowl of candy outside while you watch these festive flicks in peace!</p> <br>"
