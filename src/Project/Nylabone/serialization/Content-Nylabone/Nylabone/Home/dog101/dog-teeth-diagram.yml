        <br /><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever looked inside your furry friend&rsquo;s mouth, you probably noticed just how different their teeth are from your own. Dogs love to chew just about anything they can get their mouths on, and their teeth are intended to help them chomp their way through meat, bones, and more. In fact, every tooth serves a specific purpose. Our dog teeth diagram below shows how many teeth dogs have and explains the purpose of these pearly whites.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img height="430" alt="Dog Teeth Diagram" width="710" src="-/media/FC20AAC16A6F407280FB96E5A898D99E.ashx" /></p> <h2>Types of Dog Teeth</h2> <p>Dogs have four kinds of teeth: molars, premolars, canines, and incisors. Each one plays a unique role in your dog&rsquo;s dental well-being.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Molars</h3> <p>Found all the way in the back of your dog&rsquo;s mouth, molars break apart hard foods and chews such as kibble, rawhide, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/edible-chew-treats/healthy-edibles-biscuits-grain-free-dog-treats" target="_blank">dog biscuits</a>. Only a small part of each molar is visible, giving these teeth a flat appearance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Premolars</h3> <p>Premolars tear apart whatever your dog is chewing and are located just in front of the molars. Ever notice how your furry friend sometimes chews using the side of their mouth? They&rsquo;re putting their premolars to work!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Canines</h3> <p>Intended for gripping objects, canines are those four fang-like teeth toward the front of the mouth. From gnawing on a meaty chew to carrying around their favorite <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/play-toys" target="_blank">dog play toy</a>, your furry friend uses these teeth to keep items locked in place.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Incisors</h3> <p>Your dog&rsquo;s incisors are located at the very front of their mouth. Originally intended to scrape meat from bones in the wild, the incisors are also used to nibble on items and pick debris, ticks, and insects out of the coat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>How Many Teeth Do Dogs Have?</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="Brown Dog Smiling" width="710" src="-/media/AA34750658154C9BA14CDBDAF8CAEFEC.ashx" /></p> <p>Adult dogs have 42 teeth. If you look closely at our dog teeth diagram, you&rsquo;ll notice dogs do not have the same number of teeth on the top and bottom of their mouth. That&rsquo;s because adult dogs have two additional molars on their bottom jaw.</p> <p>Puppies only have 28 baby teeth, also known as &ldquo;milk teeth.&rdquo; All permanent teeth come in by about six months of age, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/teeth-teething-and-chewing-in-puppies" target="_blank">Veterinary Centers of America</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tips for Promoting Dog Oral Health</p> <p>Your dog will need some help keeping their teeth squeaky clean! Fortunately, there are ways you can promote a healthy, happy smile.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Establish a Dental Care Routine</h2> <p>You aren&rsquo;t the only one who needs regular brushing! Plaque and tartar can build up quickly in your pup&rsquo;s mouth, so it&rsquo;s important to break out a dog-friendly toothbrush and toothpaste often. Aim to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth" target="_blank">brush your dog&rsquo;s teeth</a> every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/guide-to-mastering-dog-dental-care" target="_blank">Read Now: A Guide to Mastering Dog Dental Care</a></h1> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Use Dog Dental Chews</h3> <p>Although nothing should replace regular brushing, there are ways to supplement your dog&rsquo;s dental routine. Fun solutions such as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/nutri-dent" target="_blank">dental chew treats</a>, chew toys with ridges and nubs, and even natural chews help clean teeth through chewing action. Dental liquids, foams, and sprays are also available to help keep your pup&rsquo;s mouth in great shape.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Schedule Annual Vet Checkups</h3> <p>Visit your veterinarian once a year to inspect your dog&rsquo;s teeth and check for signs of gum disease. If the vet notices anything out of the ordinary, they may recommend a dental cleaning. This is also a great chance to learn what else you can do to care for your dog&rsquo;s teeth every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Here&rsquo;s to Your Canine&rsquo;s Canines!</h2> <p>Dogs are amazing animals, and their teeth are just as special. Whether your pup is munching on some dinnertime kibble or cleaning their fur after a day at the park, they have chompers that are perfect for the job. Although they&rsquo;re not all the same, there is one thing all of your dog&rsquo;s teeth have in common; they make a beautiful smile!&nbsp;</p>
