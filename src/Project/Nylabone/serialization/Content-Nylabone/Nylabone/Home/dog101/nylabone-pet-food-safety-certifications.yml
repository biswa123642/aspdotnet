        <br /><p><span style="color: #000000;">Ever since introducing our very first <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/edible-chew-treats" target="_blank">chew treats</a> 30 years ago, the Nylabone<sup>&reg;</sup> team has spent the past three decades developing world-class edible products for treating, rewarding, and occupying our furry friends. As Nylabone&rsquo;s dog treats continue to evolve, our priority remains the same: providing the <em>safest</em> products for every dog.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Offering outstanding products goes beyond simply treating every dog as if they were our own. In fact, before we introduce any new item to the world, we make sure our very own dogs love it first! And as pet parents, we know just how important it is to give our dogs products we can trust and feel good about&mdash;especially when it comes to chews and treats. That&rsquo;s why we at Nylabone are dedicated to making the safest, highest-quality edible products for dogs.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to proudly making and testing all Nylabone treats in the USA, we open our facilities to rigorous third-party inspections that ensure our products and manufacturing plants meet best-in-class domestic and international standards. It&rsquo;s our ongoing pledge to excellence that has earned us these globally benchmarked pet food safety certifications.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">FDA FSMA Compliance</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img height="204" alt="fda" width="500" src="-/media/883EC704991E4359AD8B4E80F3B7F4A1.ashx" /><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspects all facilities where Nylabone treats are made to ensure our facilities meet the FDA&rsquo;s rigid food safety practices. We uphold the strict standards set by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a federally mandated law that protects public health through food safety regulations. Our Food Safety plan is FSMA compliant, meaning we have incorporated preventive<strong> </strong>controls to minimize potential risks that may occur in our production process flow.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to our procedures meeting FDA pet food regulations, Nylabone&rsquo;s compliance exhibits our devotion to food safety so you can feed your dog their favorite treats with absolute confidence.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">SQF Level 2 Certification</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img height="278" alt="sfq" width="500" src="-/media/31263F777CBB493D83ECBF24EE256A92.ashx" /><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">As a globally recognized brand, we abide by a variety of standards set not just for products in the USA, but around the world! We have followed and met the criteria set by Safe Quality Food (SQF)&mdash;an internationally trusted food safety and quality program. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our facilities undergo Food Safety audits benchmarked by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) to earn SQF&rsquo;s rigorous Level 2 Certification. This successful certification shows our dedication to producing safe and reliable products for customers worldwide.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">SMETA Social Compliance Certification</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img height="99" alt="sedex" width="500" src="-/media/3390DA60B3FD429D9D8677A2830A4D9F.ashx" /><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our dedicated employees and robust manufacturing practices are responsible for making sure your dog receives the very best Nylabone treats. To ensure we are maintaining ethical business practices from start to finish, we voluntarily undergo the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA). This comprehensive inspection covers Sedex&rsquo;s four pillars of Labor, Health and Safety, Environment, and Business Ethics&mdash;all of which are critical to running our company responsibly.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">USDA Certification</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img height="90" alt="usda-aphis" width="500" src="-/media/3C96C2316442461FAA36F5C659AB6F53.ashx" /><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Whether you and your pup live in the United States or abroad, you deserve the same quality chew treats and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/healthy-edibles-biscuits" target="_blank">dog biscuits</a> all Nylabone customers expect. Our facilities undergo annual audits from the United States Department of Agriculture that certify us to export Nylabone treats to the European Union, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Korea. Conducted by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&rsquo;s team of trained veterinarians, these audits assess product safety and allow us to share our world-class treats with dogs around the globe!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">Nylabone Quality Control Team Inspections</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to meeting the rigid requirements of these pet food safety certifications, we conduct our own internal inspections to confirm all processes meet Nylabone&rsquo;s high standards. Our quality control team routinely inspects our manufacturing and packaging facilities to self-check procedures and ensure programs are up to date.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Because we value every pet parent and dog, we implemented a robust food safety testing program that further ensures product quality. We use accredited third-party testing facilities to assess our products and verify they are safe for your four-legged friend.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Love for our dogs drives everything we do, and we are firmly committed to ensuring <em>every</em> product we make is safe and of top quality.
