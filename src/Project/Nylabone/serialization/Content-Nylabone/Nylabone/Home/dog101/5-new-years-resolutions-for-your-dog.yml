        <br /><p>It&rsquo;s the New Year, and chances are you rang it in with a personal resolution you&rsquo;re determined to keep&mdash;meal prep on Sundays, read one book per month, start going to yoga (again). And if you&rsquo;re a pet parent, you want to ensure your best fur friend kicks off the new year right, too.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> When setting New Year&rsquo;s resolutions for your dog, you may find your goals aren&rsquo;t so different after all! Here are five resolutions you and your dog can work on together so you can both have your best year yet.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Resolution #1: Shed the Extra Pounds</h2> <p>Maintaining a healthy weight plays a major role in dogs&rsquo; overall well-being. However, it&rsquo;s a common struggle among pet parents&mdash;56% of dogs in the U.S. are considered overweight or obese, according to the <a href="https://petobesityprevention.org/2017/" target="_blank" title="https://petobesityprevention.org/2017/">Association for Pet Obesity Prevention</a>.<br /> <br /> We all want our pets to live long and happy lives. And although the joy of seeing your dog munch on table food may check the &ldquo;happy&rdquo; column, it&rsquo;s not always the best fuel for their canine bodies.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Stay mindful of the food your pup consumes&mdash;both as meals and treats. Choose treats that are made with natural ingredients and don&rsquo;t contain any artificial preservatives, added sugar, or salt. Once you found a <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/healthy-edibles" target="_blank" title="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/healthy-edibles">healthy dog treat</a> he enjoys, remember to practice moderation; multiple treats at a time throughout the day can add up quickly!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> When determining a sensible weight-loss plan for your pet, it&rsquo;s always best to consult your veterinarian for guidelines on dog food, portion sizes, and exercise routines that align with your pup&rsquo;s breed, age, and health.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Resolution #2: Exercise At Least Five Times Per Week</h2> <p>If one of your dog&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s resolutions is to lose a few pounds, then exercise is a key component in a weight-loss plan. Have you ever noticed how invigorated you feel after some fresh air or a good sweat session? Exercise is proven to release endorphins that make us (and dogs!) feel energetic and perky.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> You don&rsquo;t have to hike for miles or walk for hours to reap the benefits; even just short bursts of active time can help burn off some anxious energy and calories. It can be as simple as playing a few rounds of fetch or walking around the block after dinner. For those cold and dreary winter days, you can play hide and seek inside or even put a leash on your dog while you walk up and down the stairs.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Although resolutions are notorious for starting out strong and fading fast, remind yourself of the many benefits exercise offers your dog: mental stimulation, obedience training, healthy joints, increased metabolism, time to bond, and more. After a while, you will both likely <em>crave </em>exercise.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Resolution #3: Schedule Your Annual Physical&nbsp;</h2> <p>We understand that getting ourselves to the doctor every year can be a chore, but paying an annual visit to your veterinarian is one trip you do not want to skip. Aside from ensuring your dog&rsquo;s overall health is in check, consistent visits to the vet are important to spot out-of-the-ordinary conditions early, plus give you the opportunity to ask any pet-parenting questions.<br /> <br /> If you&rsquo;re new to caring for a dog, veterinary visits typically consist of a physical exam to check your dog&rsquo;s skin, eyes, ears, teeth, and more. Be prepared to answer basic questions about your pup&rsquo;s eating, sleeping, and potty schedule, too.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> There are also multiple <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/vaccinations-your-dog-needs" target="_blank" title="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/vaccinations-your-dog-needs">vaccinations your dog needs</a>, so depending on his age and medical history, he may be due for a new one.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Resolution #4: Make Time for Play Dates</h2> <p>Just like we set our own goal to make new friends or socialize more often, dogs need their own circle of buddies, too! Although some breeds don&rsquo;t enjoy the company of other pups, most love to play and hang out with other dogs.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A great first step is to <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/about-us/dog-park-finder" target="_blank" title="https://www.nylabone.com/about-us/dog-park-finder">find a local dog park</a>. Aside from allowing your dog to mingle with others, dog parks are also great for owners to get some exercise, socialize with other dog lovers, and maybe even discover a new part of the neighborhood. Always be mindful of the posted rules and be cautious when introducing your dog to others.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> If you&rsquo;re a new puppy parent, it will be beneficial to work on <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-socialize-your-puppy" target="_blank" title="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-socialize-your-puppy">socializing your puppy</a> before introducing him to strangers. Instead of the dog park, opt to hang out with friends or family members&rsquo; dogs. Knowing the temperament of other pets in your life will be a comforting advantage when playing fur-friend matchmaker.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Resolution #5: Learn Something New&nbsp;</h2> <p>We all want to grow as individuals, whether it&rsquo;s learning how to play guitar or lifting heavier at the gym. Why should dogs be any different? Teaching your sidekick a new skill will take healthy doses of patience and persistence, but the payoff of seeing him learn and grow is worth it.<br /> <br /> If you&rsquo;re starting with the basics of sit, stay, and come, or exploring some more <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/advanced-dog-training-tips" target="_blank" title="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/advanced-dog-training-tips">advanced dog-training</a> drills like standing on command, keep your sessions short but frequent.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Think of training in three steps: incentivize, command, and reward.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> 1)&nbsp; Incentivize &ndash; Show your dog a treat or toy to catch his attention.<br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: lighter;">2)&nbsp; Command &ndash; Clearly state what you want him to do, staying consistent with the word or phrase you use each time.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">3)&nbsp; Reward &ndash; Dogs respond to positive reinforcement, so rewarding him with a treat for a job well done will encourage more good behavior in the future!</span></p> <p> <br /> Whether you&rsquo;re focused on a New Year&rsquo;s resolution for your dog, yourself, or both, you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the ball to drop to begin. Work toward these goals at any time of the year for a healthier and more fulfilling life with your pup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
