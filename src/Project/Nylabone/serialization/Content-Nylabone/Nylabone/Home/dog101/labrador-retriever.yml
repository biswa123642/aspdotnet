        <h2>Labrador Retriever Personality Traits</h2>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers make incredible companions. They are among the most sensible, even-tempered, affectionate, intelligent, and willing-to-please breeds in the world. Labradors love to play with people of all ages and seem to understand the need to be gentle with children. They are enthusiastic retrievers and swimmers and can happily spend hours playing fetch. Labrador Retrievers are fairly large and athletic dogs who love to chew.</p>
        <h2>Origin and History of the Labrador Retriever</h2>
        <p>In the 1800s, ships traveling from the Canadian providence of Newfoundland and Labrador to England carried with them working dogs who were used by fisherman and hunters. The English marveled at the dogs&rsquo; retrieving abilities and obedience. In the mid-1800s, the second Earl of Marlesbury founded the first actual kennel for Labradors. By the late 1800s, a heavy dog tax in Canada caused a reduction in what was then becoming known as the Labrador Retriever. Meanwhile, in England, a quarantine law was established that effectively cut off importations. Without further contributions of working dogs from Canada, the English used the dogs they had for developing both the Flat-Coated Retriever (which was popular in the 19th century) and what is now uniformly known as the Labrador Retriever.</p>
        <p>Although the Labrador Retriever&rsquo;s rise to popularity came later than that of the Flat-Coat, it has been amazingly consistent. Today, there are two types of Labrador Retrievers: the field type and the show type. The field type is considered more energetic and is leaner than the show type, which is shorter and stockier.</p>
        <h2>How to Care for Labrador Retrievers</h2>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers require lots of exercise. They are a high spirited breed, and staying active is important for their physical and mental health. Labrador Retrievers love to swim, and their ideal outing would be a long walk leading to a body of water where they can retrieve and play.</p>
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers are moderate to heavy shedders and should be brushed frequently. Brushing helps remove the hair that would otherwise be left on furniture or clothes.</p>
        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>The average life span of a Labrador Retriever is 10 to 14 years.</p>
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>The Labrador Retriever is very obedient, and is one of the most trainable breeds. They live to please their people and are attentive and responsive during training.</p>
