        <br /><p>You come home after a long day and happily watch as your dog gallops toward you with a wagging tail. You lean down to scratch their head and give them plenty of pets when suddenly <em>it hits you</em>...that stinky dog breath!</p> <p>While it&rsquo;s not uncommon, foul dog breath can easily overwhelm the senses. Luckily, there are a variety of methods that can help freshen breath and clean teeth! Discover why your dog&rsquo;s breath stinks while learning simple solutions to make your dog&rsquo;s breath smell better.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Why Does My Dog&rsquo;s Breath Smell?</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="Dog looking up" width="710" src="-/media/CFE51B283242429CA937DC4522F4C4DD.ashx" /></p> <p>If your dog has bad breath, you should figure out why it smells in the first place. Typically, dogs have bouts of bad breath for reasons similar to humans.</p> <h3>Bad Oral Hygiene</h3> <p>Not brushing your dog&rsquo;s teeth for extended periods of time is one of the most common causes of smelly breath. As food particles linger in your dog&rsquo;s mouth, plaque and tartar can build up. Left untreated, this buildup can cause bad breath, gum disease, tooth loss, and other problems.</p> <h3>Food</h3> <p>It may come as a surprise, but the wrong <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/types-of-dog-food" target="_blank">types of dog food</a> can also lead to foul-smelling breath. If your dog&rsquo;s food is of poor quality and contains a high number of additives like sugars, this can lead to plaque and tartar buildup. Even changing your dog&rsquo;s diet can bring about digestive issues which may cause your furry friend&rsquo;s breath to stink. When changing their diet, be sure to do so gradually.</p> <h3>Sickness &amp; Disease</h3> <p>Chronic bad breath may be caused by more serious health problems. Diabetes, liver disease, and kidney disease are some issues that can give rise to dreadful dog breath. For instance, breath that smells like ammonia could be a sign of declining kidney function, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bluepearlvet.com/medical-articles-for-pet-owners/kidneys-chronic-kidney-disease-and-long-term-renal-failure/" target="_blank">Blue Pearl Pet Hospital</a>. Every pup is different, so please consult your veterinarian if your dog&rsquo;s breath is especially stinky.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>How to Get Rid of Your Dog&rsquo;s Bad Breath</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="Labrador Retriever mouth" width="710" src="-/media/5E6107441BBD4B2DB9D8FD2960228B75.ashx" /></p> <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned several possible reasons why your dog&rsquo;s breath stinks, it&rsquo;s time to freshen it up! Here are some of the most trusted, pet parent-approved dental solutions to make your dog&rsquo;s breath smell better.</p> <h3>Daily Brushing</h3> <p>Did you know that you should brush your dog&rsquo;s teeth every day? It&rsquo;s true! A daily dental care routine can help your pet maintain cleaner breath and pearly whites while reducing the risk of gum disease.</p> <p>Our Advanced Oral Care <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/dental-solutions/advanced-oral-care-dog-dental-kit" target="_blank">dog dental kit</a> is a terrific everyday option as it contains the essentials for a well-rounded dental routine. The toothpaste includes Denta-C, which is scientifically formulated to reduce plaque that harbors bacteria. Plus, there are two brushes to clean those hard-to-reach places: an angled toothbrush and a finger brush for added control.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth" target="_blank">➔RELATED: How to Brush Your Dog&rsquo;s Teeth in 5 Steps&nbsp;</a></h1> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Water Additives &amp; Sprays</h3> <p>To take your dog&rsquo;s dental routine to the next level, consider pairing your dog&rsquo;s toothbrushing sessions with water additives and dental sprays. Water additives, such as our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/dental-solutions/advanced-oral-care-liquid-breath-freshener" target="_blank">liquid breath freshener</a>, can be poured into your pup&rsquo;s water bowl to wash away mouth odors and promote clean breath as they enjoy their daily hydration!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/dental-solutions/advanced-oral-care-dental-spray" target="_blank">Dog dental sprays</a> work much like water additives but can be sprayed directly on your pup&rsquo;s teeth and gums. Best used once or twice daily, dental sprays are a convenient way to fight smelly dog breath and support overall dental health.</p> <h3>Dental Treats</h3> <p>Reward your dog for being on their best behavior while contributing to their oral care with dental treats. Between brushings, dental treats can help clean your furry friend&rsquo;s teeth, freshen breath, and reduce plaque and tartar buildup as they chew.</p> <p>For a wholesome and highly digestible treating option, consider our veterinarian-recommended <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/nutri-dent" target="_blank">dog dental chews</a>. With 360-degree brushing action, these delicious chews clean your dog&rsquo;s mouth from every angle. Plus, they&rsquo;re made with a limited-ingredient formula and contain no artificial ingredients.</p> <h3>Chew Toys</h3> <p><img height="430" alt="Dog with chew toy" width="710" src="-/media/9750454A364047AB97A6C25D398C0BD1.ashx" /></p> <p>Your dog&rsquo;s favorite chew toys not only provide a fun and relaxing activity&mdash;they help support your pup&rsquo;s dental health, too! The simple act of chewing helps scrape plaque and tartar from teeth, which in turn helps freshen breath.</p> <p>We offer lots of different chew toys to choose from, including purposefully designed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/chew-toys/power-chew/power-chew-arch-bone-dog-dental-chew-toy" target="_blank">dental chew toys</a> that have ridges and nubs for added cleaning power.</p> <h3>Professional Cleanings&nbsp;</h3> <p>In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a professional dental cleaning for your dog. Typically, this entails a thorough dental examination, teeth cleaning, and polishing to get rid of harmful tartar and plaque. X-rays may be taken to determine whether a tooth should be removed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Bye-Bye Stinky Breath!</h2> <p>As a pet parent, there are many ways to easily promote dog dental health. Help your pup maintain fresh breath and an especially happy smile by scheduling regular checkups and incorporating dental solutions into your routine!&nbsp;</p>
