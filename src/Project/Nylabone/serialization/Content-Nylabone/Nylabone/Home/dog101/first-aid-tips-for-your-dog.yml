      Value: "<br /><p> All dog owners hope that their dog will avoid injury, and many take precautions to try to make sure this is the case. But what if the worst happens and your pup is injured in some way? You need to be prepared to give him the best emergency assistance that you can. One of the best ways to prepare for an emergency is to have certain supplies on hand, including the following: </p><p> <li> Antibacterial ointment </li> <li> Aspirin </li> <li> Cotton Balls </li> <li> Gauze pads and bandages </li> <li> Hydrogen peroxide (3 percent) </li> <li> Petroleum jelly </li> <li> Rubbing Alcohol </li> <li> Scissors </li> <li> Tape </li> <li> Towel </li> <li> Tweezers </li> </p><p> Having these items on hand will help to ease your mind when you are faced with an emergency situation. Keeping calm is very important because it will help your dog to stay calm as well. You can speak to him in a calm, reassuring voice and help him to know that everything's okay. </p><p> In certain emergency situations, it may be a good idea to muzzle your dog (with an actual muzzle, or even with a necktie or a scarf) to prevent fear biting. Even if your dog never bites, an extreme circumstance may cause him to do things that would normally be out of character for him, which is another reason to remain calm around him. </p><h2> Cuts &amp; Scratches </h2><p> Any active dog will get his fair share of cuts and scratches, most of which can be taken care of quite easily. First, thoroughly flush the area with water to make sure the affected area is clean of debris and dirt. Then, apply an antibiotic cream a few times a day until the injury has healed. </p><p> If a cut is accompanied by severe bleeding, press a thick gauze pad or towel against the wound to minimize the flow of blood. Then, get your pup to the veterinarian as soon as possible. </p><h2> Wild Animal Encounters </h2><p> Most companion dogs will never encounter any particularly scary wild animals. The closest they may come is meeting up with a rabbit, squirrel, or skunk. Generally, the most damage these encounters will offer is a few cuts or scratches. However, if your dog meets up with a skunk, additional measures will be required. </p><p> If your dog has been sprayed by a skunk, you&rsquo;ll need to give him a good bath to get rid of the scent. Ordinary shampoos probably won&rsquo;t do the trick, so use a commercial anti-skunk remedy available at most pet stores. Wet your dog, rub the remedy on, and let it set in for a few minutes. Then, rinse thoroughly. </p>"
