Our eyes locked and the rest is history. It was a perfect match! I’m thankful every day to have been blessed with such a beautiful, loyal, amazing companion.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 18px;"><strong>BIG BROTHER BUBBA</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Lyn West:</strong> “We met at work, started dating, moved in together, and then brought home our Frenchie, Bubba, and raised him together. Now we’re engaged, and Bubba is going to be a big brother to a little sister—we are expecting on April 14th. Our lives just keep getting happier one day at a time. I love my family and I’m so happy to have them.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 18px;"><strong>DOG-APPROVED DATES ONLY</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Dustie Marie Staten: </strong>“My Gabriel helped me find my husband. Within the first few dates, Gabriel would decide if I stayed with the guy or not. He would get between the guy and me and growl if they tried to touch me. With my husband, on the other hand, he got between us on the couch and he simply laid down and snuggled. My husband and I have been together 8.5 years. Our Gabriel passed from cancer 1 year and 3 months ago.”</span></p> <p><img alt="dog-love-story-2-new" src="-/media/B3C2CF158B884B70B15CA2CFA0D0D8DE.ashx" style="height: 279px; width: 385px;" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Photo credit: Dustie Marie Staten, Facebook</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">LOVE THE PUP YOU’RE WITH</span></strong></p> <strong>Taylor Smith:</strong> I love my dogs more than I love my husband, so that’s my story!
