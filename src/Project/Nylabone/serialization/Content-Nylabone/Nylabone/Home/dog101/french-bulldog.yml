        <h2>Origin and History</h2>
        <p>To say that the French Bulldog is a purely French breed is a bit of a misnomer. Bulldogs were at the height of their popularity in England the 1860s, and small varieties of that breed were especially popular in the lace-making region of the English midlands. The Industrial Revolution caused a downturn for the lace makers, and the craftsmen moved to France, bringing their toy Bulldogs with them. There they were bred with various French breeds to create what is now the French Bulldog. At the time, the developing breed was produced with both &ldquo;bat ears&rdquo; (erect) and &ldquo;rose ears&rdquo; (folded, like the Bulldog). Europeans tended to prefer the latter, going for a dog who was practically a miniature Bulldog; American fanciers, on the other hand, were smitten with the bat ears. After much hullabaloo (which included bat-ear devotees storming out of the 1898 Westminster dog show and forming their own, bat-ear only, show), it was the Americans who eventually prevailed in fixing the bat-ear style, which became one of the hallmarks of the breed.</p>
        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
        <p>Playful&mdash;even clownish&mdash;inquisitive, and affectionate, the French Bulldog (&ldquo;Frenchie&rdquo;) is an exceptional companion and playmate. His bright, alert expression conveys his fun-loving attitude. He gets along well with everyone, including other pets and dogs, and he is essentially a happy-go-lucky fellow. Easy to care for and easygoing, if the Frenchie has a fault, it may be that he tends to snore and drool&mdash;results of his shortened muzzle.</p>
        <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>The French Bulldog doesn&rsquo;t need a lot of exercise, but he is most happy accompanying his owner on walks around the neighborhood or on daily adventures. He should not be over-exercised in the heat, as his shortened muzzle makes it more difficult for him to breathe.</p>
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>The French Bulldog&rsquo;s short, soft coat is easily kept neat and clean with occasional brushing. The wrinkles on his face should be kept clean and dry to discourage infection.</p>
        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>10 to 12 years.</p>
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>The Frenchie has a stubborn streak, but his good-heartedness will prevail if training is made worthwhile for him. He responds best to training that appeals to the extrovert in him, and harsh training methods will cause him to shut down.</p>
