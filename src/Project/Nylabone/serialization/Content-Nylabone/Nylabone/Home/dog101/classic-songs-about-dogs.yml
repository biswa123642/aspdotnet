        <br /><p><span style="text-align: justify; color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs make quite an impression on our lives, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that they&rsquo;ve made their way into some of our favorite songs, too! From rock to pop to R&amp;B, four-legged friends have inspired musicians for decades, and many pup-related tunes remain relevant to this day.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Keep reading to learn about some of the most famous songs about dogs...and check out our curated Spotify playlist for our top picks!</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <span style="color: #3f3f3f;"> <iframe style="border-radius:12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3TiWkZgxNoB43umitC7Jqd?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe> </span> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#1. I Love My Dog &ndash; Yusuf / Cat Stevens</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Yusuf / Cat Stevens&rsquo; first ever single, &ldquo;I Love My Dog,&rdquo; is a folk-rock melody released in 1966. The lyrics chronicle the unconditional love that the songwriter&rsquo;s dog shows him, and he comically compares it to the love shared between two people&mdash;but better.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">In an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://majicat.com/yusufislam/mojo2000.htm" target="_blank">interview</a> with <em>Mojo</em> magazine, Yusuf / Cat Stevens revealed the song was inspired by a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/dachshund" target="_blank">Dachshund</a> he found outside of a bookshop as a child. After taking the "sausage dog&rdquo; home, he grew very attached to it.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#2. Atomic Dog &ndash; George Clinton</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah. Need we say more? Released in 1982, this funky R&amp;B hit features panting, barking, and many dog-related metaphors. Maintaining cult-like status, it&rsquo;s been sampled in several hip-hop songs and featured in various film trailers including ones for <em>102 Dalmatians</em>, <em>Hotel for Dogs</em>, and <em>Scooby-Doo: The Movie</em>.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#3. I Want a Dog &ndash; Pet Shop Boys</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">It&rsquo;s said that English duo &ldquo;Pet Shop Boys&rdquo; took their name from friends who worked at a pet shop. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough of an animal reference for you, this 1987 dog song is all about wanting a pup to return home to at night! Dogs make terrific companions, and this electronic tune even namedrops a specific breed&mdash;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/chihuahua" target="_blank">Chihuahua</a>.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#4. Seamus &ndash; Pink Floyd</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><img height="430" alt="woman and dog listening to music" width="710" src="-/media/0CDF7D3E1C034050AEA061A9B81683A8.ashx" /></span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">The final A-side track on the 1971 album <em>Meddle</em>, &ldquo;Seamus&rdquo; is named after the Border Collie who howls throughout this blues-inspired ditty. He belonged to Humble Pie frontman Steve Marriot, who was amazed to learn of his four-legged friend&rsquo;s love for singing, according to <em>Comfortably Numb&mdash;The Inside Story of Pink Floyd</em> by Mark Blake. </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">This song was only performed live once for the 1972 documentary <em>Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii</em>. Instead of Seamus, a Borzoi named Nobs provided the howling accompaniment.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#5. Quiche Lorraine &ndash; The B-52's</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Quiche Lorraine isn&rsquo;t just the name of a savory French tart...it&rsquo;s also the name of a stylish <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/poodle">Poodle</a> sung about in this eccentric 1980 party tune by The B-52's! The lyrics state that Quiche Lorraine has dark green fur and wears sunglasses, a bonnet, and designer jeans with appliques on them. Not only that, but she leaves her pet parent in favor of a Great Dane (<em>gasp</em>)!</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#6. Rover &ndash; Jethro Tull</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><em>Heavy Horses</em>, the eleventh studio album by British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, features multiple songs written from the perspective of animals such as farm cats, horses, mice, and moths. Of course, Jethro Tull couldn&rsquo;t forget about our favorite furry friends and wrote the 1978 &ldquo;Rover&rdquo; from the point of view of a loyal, obedient pooch. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#7. Me and You and a Dog Named Boo &ndash; Lobo</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Lobo&rsquo;s debut 1971 single is about two free-spirited individuals (and their dog named Boo!) who travel across the country together in an old automobile. Along the way, they live off the land and take odd jobs to make ends meet. The track&rsquo;s title takes inspiration from Lobo&rsquo;s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/german-shepherd-dog" target="_blank">German Shepherd</a> Boo, who ran toward him while he wrote the song.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#8. (How Much Is) That Doggie In The Window &ndash; Patti Page</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><img height="430" alt="dog laying next to record player" width="710" src="-/media/D4206A1B6724470AB2795325649CD59E.ashx" /></span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Patti Page&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;(How Much Is) That Doggie In The Window&rdquo; reached No. 1 on the Billboard Charts in 1953, staying there for eight straight weeks. The original recording of the popular novelty song even included dogs barking, credited on the label as &ldquo;Barks by Joe and Mac.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Page recorded an updated version of the song in 2009 titled &ldquo;Do You See That Doggie in the Shelter&rdquo; to raise awareness for shelter animal adoption. The rights to the song were given exclusively to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/" target="_blank">Humane Society of the United States</a>.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#9. A Dog&rsquo;s Life &ndash; Elvis Presley</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">In the 1966 film <em>Paradise, Hawaiian Style</em>, Elvis sings this comical tune while flying an airplane. If that&rsquo;s not impressive enough, &ldquo;The King&rdquo; is also shown surrounded by multiple large dogs in the cockpit! This is fitting as the song&rsquo;s lyrics touch upon the desire to live the life of a pampered pooch, being constantly loved and cared for.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#10. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp &ndash; Led Zeppelin</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Rather than having a dog-related title, this song takes its name from Bron-Yr-Aur, a cottage in Wales where members of the band wrote much of the album <em>Led Zeppelin III</em>. The country-influenced song is about walking in the woods with lead singer Robert Plant&rsquo;s blue-eyed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/border-collie" target="_blank">Border Collie</a> named Strider, according to <em>The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin </em>by Dave Lewis.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #4472c4;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/do-dogs-like-music" target="_blank">RELATED: Do Dogs Like Music? 3 Playlists They&rsquo;ll Love!</a></span></strong><a></a><a href="RELATED: Do Dogs Like Music? 3 Playlists They’ll Love!" target="_blank"><span></span><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></a></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#11. Walking the Dog &ndash; Rufus Thomas</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">A merry tune beloved by both children and adults, Rufus Thomas&rsquo; 1963 hit makes multiple references to nursery rhymes including &ldquo;Miss Mary Mack.&rdquo; The R&amp;B dog song may be best known, however, for the whistling noises that call to Thomas&rsquo; four-legged friend throughout. It has been recorded by several artists including The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Green Day.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#12. Old Blue &ndash; The Byrds</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><img height="430" alt="person playing guitar next to dog" width="710" src="-/media/2B1E57C0FA9B4301A2C104C780A48E37.ashx" /><br /> </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&ldquo;Old Blue&rdquo; is a traditional folk song that has been covered by numerous musical artists. One of the most popular variations was recorded by folk-rock band The Byrds in 1969. Their version features the first appearance of the StringBender, an invention that allowed the group&rsquo;s guitar player to duplicate the pedal steel guitar&rsquo;s sound on his Fender Telecaster.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#13. Martha My Dear &ndash; The Beatles</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">While many listeners believed this song to be written about a love interest, Beatles frontman Paul McCartney revealed in a 1997 interview that he wrote this song about his <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/old-english-sheepdog" target="_blank"><span>Old English Sheepdog</span></a> puppy, Martha, whom he brought home in 1965. </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">In fact, McCartney is quoted as saying, &ldquo;Whereas it would appear to anybody else to be a song to a girl called Martha, it&rsquo;s actually a dog, and our relationship was platonic, believe me,&rdquo; according to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-beatles-song-paul-mccartney-wrote-for-his-sheepdog/" target="_blank"><span>Far Out Magazine</span></a>. </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></h2> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#14. The Puppy Song &ndash; Harry Nilsson</span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Nilsson wrote this upbeat tune at the request of Paul McCartney for Mary Hopkin; a young singer McCartney had just signed to his Apple Records label. It was recorded by Hopkin in 1968 and then by Nilsson a year later. The lyrics tell the story of a child who longs for a puppy of their own.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Life Without Dogs Would ♭ Flat</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs are more than just our best friends&mdash;they&rsquo;re a tremendous source of inspiration! Dating back to ancient times, dogs have encouraged humans to create extraordinary compositions like paintings, pottery, poems, and yes&mdash;music.
