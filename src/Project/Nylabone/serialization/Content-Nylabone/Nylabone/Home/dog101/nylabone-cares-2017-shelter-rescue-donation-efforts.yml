        Nylabone Cares serves to support nonprofit shelter and rescue organizations across the country. We donate chew toys and provide support to these organizations to help ease the dogs&rsquo; stress and ultimately help them find and keep their forever homes. Here are some noteworthy moments of our Nylabone Cares efforts in 2017:<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma &amp; California Wildfires</strong><br />
        In the wake of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in August&ndash;September 2017, many rescue organizations and shelters stepped up and brought in the dogs who were affected by these natural disasters. Nylabone and its parent and sister companies (Central Garden &amp; Pet, Four Paws, and Cadet) made several donations to these organizations.<br />
        <br />
        When we heard that the Natural Disaster Search Dog Foundation National Training Center had to be evacuated as a result of the Thomas Wildfire in Southern California, Nylabone Cares sprang into action, reaching out to see what we could do to help. We were able to make a donation to the evacuated dogs and a new in-kind donation was made once the Search Dog Foundation was able to return to their facility.<br />
        <br />
        We also donated toys and supplies to the following organizations that helped in these natural disaster relief efforts:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>ASPCA Distribution Center, Florida</li>
            <li>ASPCA Distribution Center, South Carolina</li>
            <li>Atlanta Humane Society</li>
            <li>Austin Pets Alive</li>
            <li>Best Friends Atlanta Pet Adoption Center</li>
            <li>Best Friends Pet Adoption Center</li>
            <li>Calhoun County Humane Society</li>
            <li>Camp Papillon Animal Shelter</li>
            <li>Florida State Animal Response Coalition</li>
            <li>Houston Humane Society</li>
            <li>Humane Society of Aransas County, Texas</li>
            <li>LA Animal Services</li>
            <li>Monmouth County SPCA</li>
            <li>Paws With a Cause</li>
            <li>St. Hubert Animal Welfare Center</li>
            <li>Tony La Russa&rsquo;s Animal Rescue Foundation</li>
            <li>Town Lake Animal Center</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Sato Dogs</strong><br />
        In partnership with other rescue organizations, the Monmouth County SPCA in New Jersey created &ldquo;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6AA7DBD366C146BBA7A8B1CFBAC981FC&amp;_z=z">The Sato Project</a>.&rdquo; As a result, they helped rescue approximately 200 abused and stranded dogs from Puerto Rico and flew them to East Coast shelters. Nylabone donated chew toys and other supplies to support the MCSPCA in their efforts.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Assistance Dogs</strong><br />
        America&rsquo;s VetDogs and their puppy with a purpose, Charlie, who appears on NBC&rsquo;s Today Show, are big fans of Nylabone. In front of millions of viewers, Charlie&rsquo;s television appearances bring attention to the needs of disabled veterans. We proudly donate to this organization as well as the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, which provides guide dogs free of charge to people who are blind or visually impaired. We also have an opportunity in 2018 with Canine Companions for Independence (CCI) to donate to their six regions that use about 50 bones each per quarter. CCI is a nonprofit organization that provides people with disabilities with highly trained assistance dogs and ongoing support.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ASPCA&rsquo;s Find Your Fido Campaign</strong><br />
        For Adopt a Shelter Dog Month, Nylabone sponsored the ASPCA&rsquo;s Find Your Fido Campaign alongside media partner The Dodo to help bring attention to homeless dogs. We also helped spread the word and encouraged dog parents in our community to become &ldquo;Fido Ambassadors&rdquo; by sharing a photo of their dog for a chance to win a year&rsquo;s supply of Nylabone chews.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Friends Fur-Ever Program</strong><br />
        Nylabone runs the annual Friends Fur-Ever Program, which connects approximately 3,000 shelters and rescues in five regions of the United States to literature about &ldquo;Steps to Success for Dog Adoption.&rdquo; At Nylabone, we want every adoption to be a successful one, so it is our mission to educate new pet parents from the point of adoption to eliminate the likelihood that a dog will be returned to a shelter.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Revamped Nylabone Cares Donation Page</strong><br />
        You may have heard about the launch of our new website&mdash;well, we have a new-and-improved <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A9FA47FCA4A14EC7B95391BC25EFE88B&amp;_z=z">Nylabone Cares page</a>&nbsp;to go along with it! This page makes it easier for shelters and rescues to request donations.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We appreciate the continuous support, heartfelt notes, and beautiful photos that we receive from so many amazing rescues and shelters across the country. It&rsquo;s really us who should be thanking you! We&rsquo;re proud to partner with organizations that are so committed to advocating for the dogs who need it the most. We&rsquo;re ready to give it our all in 2018!<br />
