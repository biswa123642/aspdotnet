      Value: "<br /><p>Smooth-coated breeds make great pets for people who don't have a lot of time to devote to grooming, because smooth coats are very easy to groom. They require nothing beyond brushing and an occasional bath.</p> <p>A smooth coat is sleek and shiny; dogs with a smooth coat look almost like they are covered with a skin rather than fur. The following are some popular smooth-coated breeds:</p> <ul>     <li>Basset Hound</li>     <li>Beagle</li>     <li>Boston Terrier</li>     <li>Boxer</li>     <li>Bulldog</li>     <li>Dalmatian</li>     <li>Great Dane</li>     <li>Greyhound</li>     <li>Labrador Retriever</li>     <li>Miniature Pinscher</li>     <li>Pug</li>     <li>Rottweiler</li>     <li>Weimaraner</li> </ul> <h2>Brushing</h2> <p>While smooth-coated dogs don't need to be brushed every day, you should give your dog a good brushing as often as you can. In addition to helping to keep the oil evenly distributed over the coat and making sure the coat is free of shed hairs and dirt, brushing your dog is also a great way to bond with him. He will enjoy both the feeling of being brushed and the pleasure of spending time with you.</p> <h2>Tools</h2> <p>The basic tool you'll need for grooming a smooth coat is a bristle brush. To start brushing, follow the direction of the hair growth. Work your way from the head back toward the tail, using just enough pressure to stimulate the skin. Be especially careful when brushing your smooth-coated dog's belly and undersides.</p>&lt;<br>"
