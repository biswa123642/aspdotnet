        <br /><p>The White House has been home to many presidential pets over the years, from parrots and pigs to roosters and raccoons. But the most &ldquo;pawpular&rdquo; animal? Dogs, of course! In fact, pups have consistently lived in the White House throughout the 1900s and well into the 21st century. Meet some of the most famous presidential dogs our nation has known:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong>1.

George Washington was an avid fox hunter and wanted a superior dog that was speedy, intelligent, and had a strong sense of smell, so he cross bred his Black and Tan Coonhounds with French Hounds to create the American Foxhound, according to the <span><a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/independence-day-special-george-washington/">American Kennel Club</a></span>. <span></span></p> Washington had more than 20 dogs and was creative when naming these furry friends.

Roosevelt had eight dogs while serving in the White House! His Scottish Terrier, Fala, was by far the most famous. He even grew so popular among Americans that he had his own secretary to sort his fan mail!<br /> <br /> You can visit a statue of Fala and FDR at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C.

A few months later, one of those puppies arrived at the White House.</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">During the Cold War, President Kennedy and Khrushchev exchanged many letters and gifts&ndash;Pushinka being the cutest gift of them all, in our opinion.

JFK kept Pushinka even though he had a <span><a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/what-to-do-if-youre-allergic-to-dogs">dog allergy</a></span>, and believed having pets in the home was an important experience for the Kennedy children.</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">While tensions ran high during the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis, many believe that JFK and Khrushchev&rsquo;s communication&mdash;and their gifts such as cute Pushinka&mdash;helped end the Cold War.</p> <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We don&rsquo;t know about you, but our dogs sure do have big paws to fill after this pup&rsquo;s world-saving resum&eacute;! </p> <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p> <strong>7.
