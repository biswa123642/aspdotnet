      Value: "<br /><p> People who choose to adopt a mixed-breed dog get the best of all worlds. They have chosen an absolutely unique pet and have opened their heart to a very special friend. </p><p> Here are five &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; breeds that add some great qualities to any dog. </p><h2> #1: Beagle Mixes </h2><p> Beagles add friendliness, energy, health, and tons of cuteness to almost any mix. Few indeed are the mixes that cannot be improved by some Beagle in the blood. </p><p> <strong>&ldquo;Designer&rdquo; examples:</strong> Puggle (Beagle and Pug); American Eagle Dog (Beagle and American Eskimo Dog); Bagel (Beagle and Basset Hound); Beabull (Beagle and Bulldog). </p><h2> #2: Poodle Mixes </h2><p> The Poodle is probably the most &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; breed, as people are interested in adding the qualities of Poodle spark, glamour, intelligence, and great hair without the perceived froufrou appearance of a purebred Poodle. </p><p> <strong>&ldquo;Designer&rdquo; examples:</strong> Airedoodle (Poodle and Airedale); Aussiedoodle (Poodle and Australian Shepherd); Bich-Poo (Poodle and Bichon Frise); Bordoodle (Poodle and Border Collie); Cavapoo (Poodle and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel); Corgipoo (Poodle and Corgi). Really, the possibilities are endless here. </p><h2> #3: German Shepherd Dog Mixes </h2><p> German Shepherd Dog in the bloodline adds intelligence, stability, loyalty, and most important, trainability. Crossing a GSD with a mild-mannered breed like a Golden Retriever brings out a bolder, more independent companion. </p><p> <strong>&ldquo;Designer&rdquo; examples:</strong> Chow Shepherd (GSD and Chow Chow); Golden Shepherd (GSD and Golden Retriever); Lab Shepherd (GSD and Labrador); Shepherd Collie (GSD and Collie); Siberian Shepherd (GSD and Siberian Husky); Shepherd Pit (GSD and Pitbull). </p><h2> #4: Labrador Retriever Mixes </h2><p> The Lab mix is another extremely common one, and why not? Labs offer stability, friendliness, dependability, and high trainability to any mix. In addition, the Lab&rsquo;s everyday appearance can be transformed into something magical with the right breed combination. It is no accident that Lab mixes are highly sought after. </p><p> <strong>&ldquo;Designer&rdquo; examples:</strong> Labaire (Lab and Airedale); Labbassador (Lab and Basset Hound); Labrabull (Lab and Pitbull); Labloodhound (Lab and Bloodhound); Labradoodle (Lab and Poodle); Sheprador (Lab and Australian Sheepdog). </p><h2> #5: Terrier Mixes </h2><p> Terriers of all kinds supply energy, toughness, grit, spirit, and good health to any cross. Nothing livens up a staid, stale bloodline like a little terrier added in, just for fun! </p><p> <strong>&ldquo;Designer&rdquo; examples:</strong> Boston Yorkie (Yorkshire Terrier and Boston Terrier); Chorkie (Chihuahua and Yorkshire Terrier); Dorkie (Yorkshire Terrier and Dachshund); Jug (Jack Russell Terrier and Pug); Siberian Terrier (Siberian Husky and Boston Terrier). </p><p> <strong>Diane Morgan</strong> is a pet care expert in Williamsport, Maryland, who has authored numerous books on dog care and nutrition, and has also written many dog breed and horse books. </p>"
