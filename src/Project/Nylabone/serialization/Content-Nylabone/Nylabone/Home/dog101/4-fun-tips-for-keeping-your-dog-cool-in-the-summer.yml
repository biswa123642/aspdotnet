        <br /><p><span style="color: #000000;">All year we wait for that moment when we can finally ditch our jackets and feel the warm sunshine on our faces. But as the days get longer and brighter, it&rsquo;s never long before a record-breaking sweltering day has us searching for relief. Chances are if you find yourself seeking the nearest shade to cool off, your dog is, too! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ensuring your fur friend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/keeping-your-dog-safe-in-the-summer-heat" target="_blank">stays safe in the heat</a> while also having a good time is essential to fun in the sun.

And on a hot, humid day, your dog will savor a &ldquo;chiller&rdquo; chewing experience with a fun, freezable chew toy. In addition to cooling your best friend off, a chilled chew toy will encourage healthy chewing habits and keep your dog happily entertained. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Nylabone offers many different freezable chew toys to match any chewing style, such as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/chew-toys/moderate-chew/moderate-chill-and-chew-treat-toy" target="_blank">Moderate Chill &amp; Treat Chew Toy</a>, which can be filled with your dog&rsquo;s favorite treats and then frozen.

Plus, it&rsquo;s a great way you and your best friend can incorporate some exercise into the day. Before diving into the water together, ensure that you brush up on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/dog-swim-safety-quiz" target="_blank">dog swimming safety</a>. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you don&rsquo;t have a pool, a dog-friendly kiddie pool works great for your pup to beat the heat. Ensure your kiddie pool is designed for dogs because your pooch&rsquo;s nails may cut through the material of an inflatable baby pool. You should also make sure the water temperature is not too hot before filling the pool&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re using a hose that has been lying in the sun.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">No matter the size of your pool, it is always a good idea to add in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/play-toys/nyla-play-ring-thing" target="_blank">floating dog toy</a> for extra pool time enjoyment and interactive play while your pooch splashes around!</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #000000;">Sprinkler-in-the-Sun Fun</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img height="430" alt="dog-in-sprinkler" width="710" src="-/media/BEB5FF63BB1541398789243F1DD6E406.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Don&rsquo;t have access to a pool? Another fun tip for how to keep your dog cool in the summer is to turn on the sprinklers! Your dog will love running through the water&mdash;and you might just have the greenest grass on the block! To provide your dog some unexpected amusement, you can even set your sprinklers to go on periodically throughout the day.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Incorporating a game of fetch as your fur friend frolics through the water can add more excitement, promote exercise, and encourage bonding between the two of you.
