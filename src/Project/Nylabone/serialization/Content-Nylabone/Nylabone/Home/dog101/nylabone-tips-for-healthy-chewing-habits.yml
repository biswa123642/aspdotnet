      Value: "<br /><p> Dogs explore their world through chewing, and they&rsquo;ll chew on just about anything they can get their paws on. Although chewing is a common item on a dog&rsquo;s to-do list, owners need to prevent inappropriate and destructive chewing by teaching their dogs which things are meant for chewing and which are not. </p><h2> Puppies and Chewing </h2><p> Chewing is a natural behavior for puppies, especially when they&rsquo;re teething. Teething triggers a strong urge to chew to relieve discomfort and help puppies remove their baby teeth. Thus, few owners escape puppyhood without having to trash a pair of shoes. The keys to keeping your puppy from forming a bad habit and destroying your valuables are prevention and management. </p><h2> Prevent Bad Behavior </h2><p> First and foremost, always know what your puppy is up to. If you can&rsquo;t keep a steady eye on him, put him in a playpen, crate, or gated area. Don&rsquo;t give him free rein of your home until he&rsquo;s fully trained. Stow away all items that your puppy might pick up or chew on, such as shoes, purses, books, and electrical cords. </p><p> Always make sure that your dog gets plenty of mental and physical exercise each day so that relaxing on his bed for a while is more appealing to him than chewing. It&rsquo;s also up to you to encourage positive chewing behaviors so your puppy is able to exercise his jaws, keep his teeth clean, and satisfy his natural desire to chew. </p><h2> Manage Inappropriate Chewing </h2><p> Several toys are designed to safely satisfy a dog&rsquo;s need to chew, and they come in different sizes, flavors, and shapes. They serve to occupy your dog so he&rsquo;s not tempted to entertain himself with your personal belongings. Always match the chew toy to your dog&rsquo;s size and chewing strength. Keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t swallow large pieces, and promptly replace worn chew toys with new ones. </p><p> Be realistic in your expectations&mdash;never scold your dog for inappropriate chewing. Simply interrupt the behavior and offer him a chew toy so he knows what he can gnaw on. </p>"
