        <br /><p>Autumn is one of the most beautiful times of the year. Unfortunately, it’s also a time when your dog’s health could be at risk. Weather changes, shedding trees, and changes in wildlife behavior can affect your pooch in unexpected ways. Look out for these autumn dog dangers:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>#1: HORSE CHESTNUTS</h2> <p>Horse chestnuts have spiky shells that commonly fall to the ground in the autumn. When ingested by dogs, they can cause retching, vomiting, drooling, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Although serious poisoning is rare, horse chestnuts will probably make your dog sick if he eats them. Supervise your pup whenever he’s outside.</p> <h2>#2: ACORNS</h2> <p>Acorns present an even greater danger to dogs. They contain a toxic ingredient called tannic acid that is linked to liver and kidney damage in dogs. Dogs eating acorns could suffer from diarrhea, abdominal pain, lethargy, and vomiting. Keep an eye out for acorns throughout fall and winter.</p> <h2>#3: FALLEN LEAVES</h2> <p>Fallen leaves often develop mold and bacteria, especially when they’re raked into piles. If your dog eats leaves, they may upset his stomach. Keep your yard clear of leaves and bag them up after raking, and make sure your dog doesn’t try to eat leaves when <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/teaching-your-dog-to-walk-on-a-leash?__hstc=27337699.427a67b590ae2022a788e5f89d1a82b3.1513112619357.1525876209765.1525889557079.124&amp;__hssc=27337699.8.1525889557079&amp;__hsfp=3306133759" target="_blank">going for a walk</a>.</p> <h2>#4: DOG FALL ALLERGIES</h2> <p>It’s not only humans who suffer from seasonal allergies—autumn mold and ragweed can cause sneezing, itchy throat, and watery eyes in dogs as well. Clean your dog with baby wipes after he spends time outside. If symptoms of dog fall allergies persist, schedule an appointment with the vet.</p> <h2>#5: TICKS</h2> <p>Although ticks can be more abundant in the summer, they persist throughout autumn. As many animals begin to hibernate, ticks search for new hosts, and dogs often become the victims. Check your pooch <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/check-your-dog-for-ticks?__hstc=27337699.427a67b590ae2022a788e5f89d1a82b3.1513112619357.1525876209765.1525889557079.124&amp;__hssc=27337699.8.1525889557079&amp;__hsfp=3306133759" target="_blank">for ticks</a> year-round. Here’s how to remove a tick from a dog:<br> 1.<span> </span>Clean the bite location with rubbing alcohol.<br> 2.<span> </span>Grip the tick with a pair of tweezers as close to your dog’s skin as possible.<br> 3.<span> </span>Slowly pull the tick off of your dog.<br> See the vet if you can’t remove the tick. Some bites can cause Lyme disease, so try to get the tick removed as quickly as possible, and always use preventive flea and tick treatment.</p> <h2>#6: CLOSED POOLS</h2> <p>Water that collects on closed pool covers doesn’t usually evaporate quickly. If your dog gets on the cover, he may slip and struggle to get out. In severe instances, extremely cold pool-cover water can cause hypothermia. Make sure your covered swimming area isn’t accessible by any of your pets.</p> <h2>#7: RODENTICIDES</h2> <p>When rodents try to sneak indoors during the cold months, homeowners may use rodenticides to keep them out. If you use rodenticides, put them in areas where your dog cannot get to them. Symptoms of rodenticide poisoning in dogs include vomiting blood, seizures, weakness, and panting. If you think your dog may have ingested a rodenticide, call the vet immediately.</p> <h2>#8: MUSHROOMS</h2> <p>Cool, wet weather creates an ideal environment for mushrooms. Although many mushrooms are harmless, some are poisonous if your dog eats them. These are the most dangerous fungi:<br> •<span> </span>Fly Agaric mushrooms (identified by white stems and red tops with white spots)<br> •<span> </span>Autumn Galerina mushrooms (identified by brown, floppy tops)<br> Don’t take any chances when it comes to dogs and mushrooms; assume all mushrooms may be dangerous to your fur kid.<br> <br> <br> Always watch your dog when he goes outside. Try to keep your yard clear of potential hazards, and be mindful of all the symptoms mentioned above.
