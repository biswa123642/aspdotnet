        <h2>Pit Bull Personality Traits</h2>
        <p>American Pit Bull Terriers make excellent companions when they are raised and trained with respect and knowledge. Although they have a reputation for aggression, a properly bred APBT is kind and caring toward children, intelligent, easily trained, loving, playful, expressive, faithful, and versatile. Theyare Some may have aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and a strong prey drive, but some get along perfectly well with other pets. They need a responsible owner who knows the breed, knows how to properly socialize them, and knows how to avoid potentially problematic situations.</p>
        <h2>Origin and History of the Pit Bull</h2>
        <p>The American Pit Bull Terrier descends from Molossians, early Greek Mastiff-type dogs who were commonly found in fighting arenas throughout the Roman Empire. Developed from bull and terrier types, APBTs were originally used by butchers to manage bulls and by hunters to help catch and hold wild boars and other game. In England, these tasks evolved to become the sports of bull- and bear-baiting, the act of pitting dogs against bulls or bears, until these blood sports were outlawed in 1835 and dog fighting sprang up in its place. These dogs gained a reputation for being strong, handsome, loyal, and affectionate with their families. In fact, the breed quickly became popular in the United States as a hunting dog and family companion, and dog fighting was outlawed in most states by the 1860s. Although dog fighting is illegal in most countries, including the United States, the APBT&rsquo;s negative reputation for being a fighting dog has stayed with him. Those who own and admire him for who he really is&mdash;and do so responsibly&mdash;hold the future of the breed in their hands.</p>
