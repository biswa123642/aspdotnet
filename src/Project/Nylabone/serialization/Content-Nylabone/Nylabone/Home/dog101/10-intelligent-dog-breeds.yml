        <br /><p> Intelligence comes in many forms&mdash;especially when it comes to dog breeds! One type of intelligence often associated with dogs is trainability, or the ability to understand and follow commands consistently. There are many other kinds of intelligence, such as social intelligence, the ability to play nicely with other dogs and get along in groups. Another is cunning ability, the ability for a dog to get what they want before their pet parent has a clue what&rsquo;s going on. These intelligent dog breeds are smart in more ways than one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #1: Golden Retriever </h2> <p> <span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><img height="430" alt="golden retriever with tongue out" width="710" src="-/media/A7370B53E3C5442799B49AA53F7678C1.ashx" /></span></span></p> <p><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">While almost every list of the smartest dog breeds puts the Border Collie in the number-one spot, we&rsquo;re handing the trophy to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/golden-retriever" id="link_1638892979493" target="_blank">Golden Retriever</a>. This breed combines high trainability with an intuitive social brilliance that allows these furry friends to get along with other dogs, humans, and even the family cat. Calm and stable, Goldens use their intelligence in ways that endear them to the entire family. It is not an accident that Goldens regularly top all other breeds in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/dog-training-for-beginners" target="_blank" id="link_1638893067849">obedience training</a>.</span></span></p> <p><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW150467386 BCX0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2> #2: Poodle </h2> <p><img height="430" alt="Poodle on grass" width="710" src="-/media/082C945CFE4B45138AF9C05B63429AAF.ashx" /></p> <p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/poodle" target="_blank" id="link_1638893093386">Poodle</a> just sparkles with brilliance. This intelligent dog breed can open doors, scale fences, and do homework for your middle schooler. (Okay, that last one might be a stretch.) All three varieties&mdash;Toy, Miniature, and Standard&mdash;are quite clever, but the Standard is the top dog. Standard Poodles excel at a variety of tasks, from trotting off to win at Westminster to competing in agility trials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #3: Shetland Sheepdog </h2> <p><img height="430" alt="shetland sheepdog running obstacle course" width="710" src="-/media/C9BF0ABAC9344D6CA129E7BDC0CDE8FB.ashx" /></p> <p>The little <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/shetland-sheepdog" target="_blank" id="link_1638893126682">Shetland Sheepdog</a> shines in high-level obedience, agility, and interactive <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/games-and-competitions-for-active-dogs" target="_blank" id="link_1638893585908">dog games</a>. These dogs also have a sweet, sensitive temperament that makes them extremely attuned to their pet parents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #4: Border Collie </h2> <p><img height="430" alt="border collie with tongue out" width="710" src="-/media/6C6F29A418CA4AD99A0FA22D61AB7C86.ashx" /></p> <p>When it comes to sheer logic, problem solving, and brainpower, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/border-collie" target="_blank" id="link_1638893143136">Border Collies</a> are among the most intelligent dogs. They can learn the names of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of objects, and they understand complex directions extraordinarily well. Their only drawback is their instinct for herding can be triggered by the presence of children or other pets. Unless you are sure you are smarter than a Border Collie, this breed may not be for you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #5: German Shepherd&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="german sherpard with tongue out" width="710" src="-/media/B099C299AF4E4ABAB5D631AE017CBAAF.ashx" /></p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/german-shepherd-dog" target="_blank" id="link_1638893254082">German Shepherds</a> are not only some of the most intelligent dogs, but they are also workaholics who thrive on doing important jobs. This is the original can-do dog, exceling in everything from protection work to guiding the blind to herding ducks. There is little German Shepherds can&rsquo;t do, and their high trainability is tough to match.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/10-top-trainable-dog-breeds" target="_blank" id="link_1638893270033">RELATED: 10 Top Trainable Dog Breeds</a></h1> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2>#6: Labrador Retriever&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="smiling labrador retriever" width="710" src="-/media/D84A9500A1614A3B98C2C69035FEC9CD.ashx" /></p> <p>Similar to the Golden but with more goofiness is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/labrador-retriever" target="_blank" id="link_1638893332939">Labrador Retriever</a>.

The original breed standard for this dog was based on the dingo&mdash;Australia&rsquo;s native wild dog&mdash;and the Cattle Dog shares the dingo&rsquo;s keen, cunning intelligence. They are highly territorial and not particularly friendly to strangers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #8: Doberman Pinscher </h2> <p><img height="430" alt="doberman pinscher in woods" width="710" src="-/media/6346C274A5C64891B92798800D943F3A.ashx" /></p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/doberman-pinscher" target="_blank" id="link_1638893364239">Dobermans </a>are smart and easy to train, and they&rsquo;re impeccably loyal to their family.

These dogs are so attuned to their companions that many Papillon pet parents are convinced their pets can read minds. Papillons are also careful observers of everything around them, and their brains and stamina work together to make them the top agility dog in their size category.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2> #10: Rottweiler </h2> <p><img height="430" alt="rottweiler on grass" width="710" src="-/media/60C2D179A96F40AD8A7D073E21C8C1BC.ashx" /></p> <p>The somber, steadfast <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/rottweiler" target="_blank" id="link_1638893377556">Rottweiler</a> is both a herding dog and a guard dog, combining several kinds of intelligence in one awesome package. While not as agile as most of the other breeds on this list, Rottweilers make up for it with their imposing size and even more imposing brain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4> Every Pup Is a Smart Pick!</h4> <p>Although this list contains some of the smartest dog breeds overall, <em>every </em>type of furry friend has unique qualities that make them a great pet. In fact, there is one particular quality that members of every breed possess: the ability to be a loyal, loving companion!<br /> <strong><br /> Diane Morgan</strong> is a pet care expert in Williamsport, Maryland, who has authored numerous books on dog care and nutrition, and has also written many dog breed and horse books.</p>
