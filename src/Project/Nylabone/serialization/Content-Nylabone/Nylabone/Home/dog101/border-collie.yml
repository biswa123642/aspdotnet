        <h2>Origin and History</h2>
        <p>The Border Collie is a sheep herding dog developed in the border country between Scotland, England, and Wales. Hundreds of years ago, most breeds of dogs were not clearly defined, and the Border Collie was simply known as a collie, sheepdog, or shepherd&rsquo;s dog. The formation of the International Sheep Dog Society in 1906 helped stimulate interest in the shepherd and establish the Border Collie&rsquo;s modern heritage. The breeding programs started to favor the quality of &ldquo;eye&rdquo; (a hypnotic stare that wills the sheep to move and turn) and a more trainable nature in order to win herding trials. The first notable dog of type was Old Hemp, born in 1894, who is considered the founder of the modern Border Collie breed. Today, besides working as exceptional farm dogs, Border Collies are renowned for their prowess in the fast-paced sport of agility, where accuracy and speed matter.</p>
        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
        <p>Border Collies are considered one of the most intelligent breeds of dog on the planet. They are energetic, sturdy, sensitive, and able to make snap decisions on their own. They are friendly with familiar people and standoffish with strangers. Most Border Collies are workaholics&mdash;driven to herd anything and everyone continuously, although occasionally a more laid-back temperament can be seen. All Border Collies are happiest when given a chore and need to have an outlet for their energy.</p>
        <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>The Border Collie needs lots of vigorous physical exercise to keep him content. He needs mental stimulation as well&mdash;chores, activities, attention, and tasks.</p>
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>Both the coarser-haired and sleek-coated Border Collies need regular brushing to keep their coats free of dead hair and looking their best.</p>
        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>12 to 15 years.</p>
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>The Border Collie&rsquo;s intense drive, desire, and intelligence make him exceptionally trainable.</p>
