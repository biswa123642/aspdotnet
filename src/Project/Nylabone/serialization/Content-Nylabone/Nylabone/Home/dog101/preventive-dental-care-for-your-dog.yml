        <br /><p>There are no bones about it&mdash;preventive dental care is essential for your dog&rsquo;s overall health! In fact, dogs are likely to show early signs of gum disease by age 3, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Veterinarians believe that dental disease predisposes dogs to heart disease, diabetes, respiratory ailments, and other illnesses&mdash;underscoring the importance of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1237737D8E5348908F097F07049AE2B0&amp;_z=z">caring for your dog&rsquo;s teeth</a> on a regular basis.</p> <p>Even with diligent, daily care, your dog may require professional dental cleanings during their lifetime, just like humans. However, an at-home oral care routine can drastically reduce the number of expensive professional dental cleanings and significantly contribute to overall good health.</p> <h2>How to Clean Your Dog&rsquo;s Teeth</h2> <p>The path to fresh breath starts with brushing your dog&rsquo;s teeth regularly. Food residue accumulates on your dog&rsquo;s teeth and can morph into plaque and tartar quickly, so even weekly brushings can make a huge difference in their oral health. Before introducing your dog to a toothbrush, follow these basic steps to get them comfortable:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li>Use your finger to gently massage their gums.</li>     <li>Put a small dab of doggy toothpaste on your index finger and let your dog taste it.</li>     <li>Apply another dab on your finger and massage their gums in a circular motion.</li> </ul> <p>Remember to keep a positive attitude, praising and reassuring your pup along the way. Once your dog is comfortable with this process, it&rsquo;s time to introduce a toothbrush or gauze pad:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li>Let your dog lick some toothpaste off a doggy toothbrush or gauze pad and praise them for a job well done. This will help accustom them to the texture of the brush or gauze while building their confidence.</li>     <li>Lift the outer lips and expose the teeth. Most owners find it easiest to start with the canine teeth&mdash;the large ones in the front of the mouth.</li>     <li>Once your dog is comfortable with you brushing a few teeth, keep going until you&rsquo;ve brushed them all.</li> </ul> <p>Spending time on your best friend&rsquo;s dental health won&rsquo;t just help create a solid bond between you&mdash;it will also give you peace of mind knowing that your dog&rsquo;s oral hygiene is getting the attention it needs. Plus, you&rsquo;ll love having a pup with clean teeth and fresh breath!</p> <h2>How Can Nylabone Help?</h2> <p>Chew toys and bones can be great allies for keeping your dog&rsquo;s teeth clean and healthy.
