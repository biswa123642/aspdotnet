        <br /><p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">A rockin&rsquo; soundtrack can elevate almost any activity. Whether you&rsquo;re getting ready for a big night out, driving with the windows down, or just spending a lazy day in the backyard, hearing a <em>really</em> good song can improve your mood and the mood of those around you...but do dogs like music, too?</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Because our furry friends are often by our sides during many of our favorite pastimes and playlists, it&rsquo;s important to understand how dogs perceive music. We&rsquo;ll explore the types of beats dogs enjoy, what they dislike, and the reasoning behind it all. Plus, stay &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; till the end for specially curated playlists dogs (and you!) will love.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">#1. Can Dogs Hear Music?</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that dogs <em>can</em> hear music! In fact, they have much sharper ears than humans when it comes to high-frequency sounds. While our ears can only hear sounds up to 64,000 Hertz, our furry friends can hear frequencies up to 67,000 Hertz, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201903/how-dogs-hear-and-speak-the-world-around-them" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a>. This means that while dogs may listen to tunes the same way we do, they can also hear frequencies that may be inaudible to humans.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">For instance, on The Beatles&rsquo; <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> album, there is a high-frequency sound featured in the final song, &ldquo;A Day in the Life.&rdquo; Paul McCartney acknowledged adding this sound specifically for pooches, saying, &ldquo;We put a sound on Sgt. Pepper only dogs can hear. If you ever play Sgt. Pepper, watch your dog!" according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gigwise.com/news/85705/" target="_blank">Gigwise</a>.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #595959;"><a><strong>RELATED: The Science Behind Sounds Only Dogs Can Hear</strong></a></span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">#2. Do Dogs Like Music?</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">We know our furry friends can <em>hear</em> music, but do they actually enjoy it? Yes, dogs do like music! While each pup is different, most prefer music that is softer in tone and not high-pitched. A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787811001845" target="_blank">Colorado State College of Veterinary Medicine study</a> revealed that easy listening music has a soothing, therapeutic effect on dogs and may mitigate stress. These tunes typically have a slow tempo of about 50&ndash;60 beats per minute.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">#3. What Kind of Music Do Dogs Like?</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="430" alt="Woman playing piano with dog" width="710" src="-/media/B050B5B350E046CA88341E6EF232496F.ashx" /></span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Speaking of easy listening, furry friends seem to love classical music! A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ufaw/aw/2002/00000011/00000004/art00002" target="_blank">Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast study</a> showed that playing classical music resulted in relaxed dog behaviors. For example, barking decreased while time spent lying down and resting increased. If you&rsquo;re looking for a great piece of music to start with, <em>The Four Seasons</em> by Vivaldi was found to have a very positive response in kenneled dogs, according to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25708275/" target="_blank">Scottish SPCA study</a>.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Some pet parents aren&rsquo;t the biggest fans of classical music, and that&rsquo;s okay! Reggae, soft rock, and spa-like music have also been found to help reduce stress and anxiety in dogs. On the other hand, genres like hard rock, grunge, heavy metal, pop, and rap usually have the opposite effect. These genres&rsquo; faster tempos are known to cause agitation, hostility, and restlessness in pups.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Ideally, you should avoid playing songs for your pooch that feature loud percussion and deep bass. These noises sound very similar to thunderstorms, <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/why-are-dogs-afraid-of-fireworks">fireworks</a>, sirens, and other sounds that dogs tend to dislike.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">#4. Does Loud Music Hurt Dogs&rsquo; Ears?</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">A dog&rsquo;s sense of hearing is four times as sensitive as a human&rsquo;s. What a person can hear at 20 feet, a dog can hear at approximately 80 feet, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201903/how-dogs-hear-and-speak-the-world-around-them#:~:text=Dogs%20have%20far%20more%20sensitive,can%20hear%20higher%2Dfrequency%20sounds." target="_blank">Psychology Today</a>. With this in mind, you should be courteous around furry friends and avoid blasting your favorite tunes at a high volume. Very loud music can hurt dogs&rsquo; ears and may even cause physical pain. If exposure is prolonged, loud music could lead to potential hearing loss. If you suspect your dog has hearing loss, contact your veterinarian.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">#5. Why Do Dogs Howl to Music?</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">With thousands of videos on the Internet highlighting this talent, howling along to music is fairly common for dogs. Songs featuring wind instruments such as clarinets and saxophones seem to invoke this response most frequently. While no one knows for sure, many believe dogs howl to music instinctually. When a pack of wolves howls, each wolf sings a different note. Therefore, dogs may attempt to mimic this ancestral practice when listening to the melody of a song.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Others think dogs howl because they are mistaking instruments for other canine howls in the distance. Whatever the answer may be, you shouldn&rsquo;t take a dog&rsquo;s howl to mean they are frightened or scared by music. If they were, they would likely hide and attempt to cover their ears instead.</span></p> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;"><br /> </span></p> <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">Listen to Our Spotify Dog Playlists</span></h2> <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="color: #595959;">It&rsquo;s amazing to think how much we have in common with our furry friends. Not only do dogs like music, but they respond to certain genres just like we do!
