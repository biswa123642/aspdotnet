      Value: "<br /><p> Cancer is as prevalent in dogs as it is in humans. It is the number one fatal disease in purebred dogs, and nearly half of all dogs who die from a natural disease die of cancer. </p><h2> Prevention </h2><p> One of the best ways to avoid cancer in your dog is to make sure he has a healthy lifestyle. This includes a wholesome, balanced diet and plenty of exercise. Feed your pup high-quality foods that meet his nutritional requirements and include elements thought to ward off cancer, which include Omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish) and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, etc.). </p><h2> Symptoms </h2><p> When grooming or petting your dog, check carefully for unusual bumps or sores. Also pay close attention to his eating and drinking habits, as increased or decreased thirst and/or appetite can be indicative of illness. If your dog is acting listless or depressed, this can also be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer. The best thing to do if you notice any of these symptoms is to bring your pup to the veterinarian as soon as possible. </p><h2> Treatment </h2><p> As in humans, different types of cancer receive different treatments, usually either radiation or chemotherapy. Your veterinarian will be able to determine what type of treatment your dog requires and will help you learn how to give him the best care possible during this difficult time. </p>"
