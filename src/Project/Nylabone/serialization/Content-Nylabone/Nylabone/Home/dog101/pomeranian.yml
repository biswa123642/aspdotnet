        <h2>Origin and History</h2>
        <p>This breed received its name from the German province from which it hailed: Pomerania. A descendant of the European herding spitz dogs, early specimens of the Pomeranian weighed up to 30 pounds and were less profusely coated than the dogs of today. It was Queen Victoria&rsquo;s love of the breed that steered it in the direction of a toy dog. She obtained one in the late 1800s and was soon breeding them at her kennels. The dogs she exhibited were typically in the 12- to 18-pound range, and the smaller size became more popular, as did a more profuse coat.</p>
        <p>By the time the Pomeranian made his way to North America, his small size and abundant coat were trademarks of the breed. A foxy ball of fluff, he is not only a beloved companion and eye-catching show dog, but he is also a talented performer of tricks and excels in agility and obedience.</p>
        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
        <p>The spunky Pomeranian is a typical spitz breed despite his small size. He is alert, active, intelligent, wary, and full of himself. He wants to be not just part of the family but part of all activities. He isn&rsquo;t clingy like some toy breeds, but his need to be included can develop into a kind of bossiness or spoiled nature. This is easily tempered with obedience training.</p>
        <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>The active Pomeranian thrives on regular exercise. He loves to get out and see the world and should be taken on several walks daily. He enjoys being the center of attention and will happily accompany his family on errands and other outings.</p>
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>The Pom&rsquo;s abundant coat needs regular attention to keep it looking its best. He is a constant shedder with a cottony undercoat, so brushing several times a week is recommended.</p>
        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>The average life span of the Pomeranian is 13 to 15 years.</p>
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>The Pomeranian is a fun dog to train because he is an eager learner. Working in a positive, motivational manner, he will soon master basic obedience and will be delighted to learn more advanced things like agility.</p>
