If you&rsquo;re thinking about adopting a dog, consider rescuing a mixed breed pup in honor of this day. This is also an excellent holiday to volunteer for your local shelter or rescue.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">The variety of dog holidays in 2022 reminds all of us just how important our fur kids are.
