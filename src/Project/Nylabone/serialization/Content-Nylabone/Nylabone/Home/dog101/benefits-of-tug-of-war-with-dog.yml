        <br /><p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong>Myth:</strong> <em>Tug-of-war teaches your dog bad behavior.</em></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong>Myth<em>:</em></strong><em> You should never let your dog win tug-of-war.</em></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong>Truth:</strong> <em>Playing tug-of-war with your dog provides them multiple mental, physical, and social benefits!</em></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Don&rsquo;t let myths about dog tug-of-war discourage you from engaging in this very fun and valuable game with your furry friend! We explore five ways this activity can help fulfill your dog while strengthening the bond you share. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Benefit #1: It Builds Your Dog&rsquo;s Confidence in Themselves <em>and </em>You </span></h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Contrary to the myths, tug-of-war can bring out the best qualities in your furry friend when played correctly. In fact, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327604JAWS0602_01" target="_blank">researchers studied</a> how the game affected dogs&rsquo; dominance and attachment behaviors toward their pet parents. They found that dogs who played tug-of-war scored higher in &ldquo;confident interactivity,&rdquo; meaning the dog exhibited confidence when playing one-on-one with their human. </span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">They also discovered that dogs were less likely to exhibit aggression if their pet parent initiated tug-of-war. This is why setting the &ldquo;rules of the game&rdquo; right from the start is essential! As the pet parent, <em>you</em> decide when it&rsquo;s time to play. Here are a few tips to establish this dynamic:</span></p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Use a command word to associate the toy with the activity, such as &ldquo;play&rdquo; or &ldquo;tug.&rdquo; </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">As you hold the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/play-toys/power-play-dog-fetch-toys-fling-a-bounce" target="_blank">tug toy</a>, don&rsquo;t let your dog get a head start in tugging. If they do, drop the toy and wait a few minutes before you restart the game. </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">If your dog brings the toy to you, don&rsquo;t immediately begin tugging. Wait a few minutes until it&rsquo;s clear that <em>you</em> are the one with the brilliant idea to play tug-of-war! </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">These &ldquo;rules&rdquo; will help ensure your dog doesn&rsquo;t use just any<em> </em>household object as a tugging toy. Plus, they reinforce that you are the boss of tug time. It won&rsquo;t be long until you&rsquo;re both confident in how this tug-of-war thing works! </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Benefit #2: It&rsquo;s a Bonding Activity</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Although some may believe tug-of-war with your dog is a game of &ldquo;pet parent versus dog,&rdquo; think of it as &ldquo;pet parent and dog versus toy.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s right&mdash;you and your furry friend are on a brave mission to bring down the toy, not each other! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">You can see this firsthand if you suddenly let go of the toy during a tugging match. Instead of taking the toy out of sight and guarding it, your dog will likely bring it back to you. When they win, they are not trying to dominate you; they&rsquo;re simply having a good time socializing and want to see who will prevail next. Winning also contributes to benefit #1&mdash;it builds confidence! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;<img height="597" alt="Dog tugging power play toy" width="800" src="-/media/945ED99993934D4A839538D17701DDE5.ashx" /><a><span></span></a></span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Benefit #3: It Engages Your Dog&rsquo;s Natural Instincts</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">So, why do dogs like tug-of-war so much? Similar to <a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why dogs like squeaky toys</span></a></span><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"></span><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">, furry friends&rsquo; love for tugging can be tied back to their ancestral roots. Centuries ago, dogs in the wild hunted to survive. Therefore, when your dog chases, shakes, and tugs a toy, they&rsquo;re mimicking how their ancient ancestors used to catch prey. Indulging this innate urge is highly rewarding for your dog!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Benefit #4: It Burns Excess Energy </span></h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">When the rain is pouring or the temperatures are plummeting, long walks and trips to the dog park aren&rsquo;t options anymore. An effective way to release all that pent-up energy? You guessed it.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Between gripping, pulling, and focusing on the toy, dog tug-of-war requires your dog to muster up a bit of physical and mental strength. It&rsquo;s no wonder they let out growls along the way&mdash;they&rsquo;re working hard!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">When the weather isn&rsquo;t on your side, add some more fun to the mix with these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/4-dog-tricks-for-rainy-days" target="_blank">cool dog tricks for rainy days</a>.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Benefit #5: It&rsquo;s a Fun Reward</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">While pet parents commonly think their dogs are motivated by food, there are many pups who thrive on playtime, too! When you come home from a day at work, engaging in tug-of-war with your dog is an entertaining way to show them some love. After all, they get an opportunity to release their excitement and spend one-on-one time with the opponent they love most: you! </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Ready, Set, Tug!</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Needless to say, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why dogs like tug-of-war so much! So, what are you waiting for?!
