        <h2>Origin and History</h2>
        <p>As early as the 1700s, dogs referred to collectively as <em>huehnerhunden</em> (bird dogs) were used by the Germans. Specific types had not yet evolved, but they stemmed directly from <em>brackes</em> and slow-working <em>schweisshundes</em> (both types of tracking hounds), refined with pointing dogs. By the 1800s, individual breeds of versatile gundogs began to be fixed.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1800s, Prince Albrecht zu Solms-Braunfels wanted to create an all-purpose hunting dog and encouraged breeders to follow function over form. His schweisshunds, the German Bird Dog, and English pointers are some of the breeds believed to have formed the basis of the German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP). Originally short and heavy bodied with long ears and a slow pace, additions of pointer blood helped create a dog who could excel in water work, retrieving, and tracking. American hunters enthusiastically received the breed when it was imported in the early 1900s. He has maintained his popularity with both serious hunters and with those who admire his good looks and ready disposition.</p>
        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
        <p>The German Shorthaired Pointer has an exuberant personality. He is enthusiastic about just about everything, whether it be walks, opportunities to hunt, being with people, going on trips, meals, or organized sports.</p>
        <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Like many of the pointing breeds, the GSP needs exercise&mdash;the more, the better. He won&rsquo;t be satisfied with a stroll around the block&mdash;he needs to run. When properly trained, the GSP should be taken regularly to parks or other open spaces where he can gallop across fields, dive into ponds, and work hedgerows for game.</p>
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>The GSP&rsquo;s short, sleek coat requires only minimal care to keep it looking neat. A good rubbing with a nubbed hound glove removes dead hair and massages the skin&mdash;a double treat.</p>
        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>The average life span of the German Shorthaired Pointer is 12 to 15 years.</p>
        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>The German Shorthaired Pointer is an eager, responsive breed. Because he is so people-oriented, he aims to please (as long as it&rsquo;s interesting to him). Short, positive training sessions conducted several times a day will accomplish the best results.</p>
