        <br />To put it simply, dogs love treats. And as pet parents, we love to treat our dogs&mdash;from providing a delicious way to clean their teeth to rewarding them when they master a trick. Plus, as you use treats to show your appreciation for your pup, you reinforce good behavior and help strengthen the bond you share. Along with a variety of flavors, shapes, and sizes, each type of dog treat provides different benefits and purposes. Learn how to choose the best dog treats for training, long-lasting enjoyment, and beyond.&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Crunchy Treats and Biscuits&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> When you hear &ldquo;dog treats,&rdquo; you probably think of small treats and biscuits. These baked snacks often come in a compact size and feature a satisfying crunchy texture, making them tasty rewards for your best friend.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Wholesome options such as our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/healthy-edibles-biscuits" target="_blank">Healthy Edibles&reg; Biscuits</a> are an excellent choice because they&rsquo;re all-natural, grain free, and contain limited ingredients; many varieties are even made with real proteins and veggies for flavors dogs love.&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Soft Treats&nbsp;</h2> <img height="430" alt="dogs-chewy-bites" width="600" src="-/media/9ED2DA9983434B91ABC0703C6D8B3CBB.ashx" /><br /> From housebreaking to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/advanced-dog-training-tips" target="_blank">advanced dog training</a>, soft treats make the ultimate training reward because these delicious, small bites provide instant gratification. Plus, they are easy to break apart, meaning you can offer your dog praise multiple times during a training session.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> These chewy treats are often great options for senior dogs because they are gentle on teeth. It&rsquo;s ideal to choose <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/edible-chew-treats/healthy-edibles-natural-chewy-bites-soft-dog-chew-treats" target="_blank">soft dog treats</a> made with natural ingredients and free from artificial preservatives.&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Dental Treats&nbsp;</h2> In addition to benefiting your dog&rsquo;s teeth and gums, regular dental care also affects your best friend&rsquo;s overall wellness because it helps reduce the risk of periodontal disease, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/pet-dental-care" target="_blank">American Veterinary Medical Association</a>. Incorporating dental treats into your dog&rsquo;s oral care routine can help keep their smile in tip-top shape!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/dental-solutions#facets=Brand:Nutri%20Dent" target="_blank">dog dental treats</a> are designed with shapes and features specifically to help clean teeth, such as 360-degree scrubbing nubs. Along with reducing plaque and tartar buildup, these treats provide dogs a tasty, long-lasting snack.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Search for dental chew treats made with quality ingredients and ideally, varieties that are veterinarian recommended. While they are one of the best dog treats for oral health, they are still treats&mdash;so limit your dog&rsquo;s intake.&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Jerky Treats&nbsp;</h2> We humans aren&rsquo;t the only ones who get to enjoy savory jerky snacks! Jerky treats for dogs are made of dehydrated meats, fish, fruits, or vegetables, offering the appetizing flavors our furry friends naturally crave. Through the dehydrating process, moisture is removed to preserve the food while retaining key vitamins and minerals. Because of the lower water content, this type of dog treat is typically tough or chewy, which provides an appealing texture.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Give your furry friend a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/search#q=jerky" target="_blank">dog jerky treat</a> that is premium quality, low in fat, and made with real ingredients. Meat and fish jerkies are especially high in protein!&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Long-Lasting Chew Treats</h2> <img height="430" alt="dog-natural-nubz" width="600" src="-/media/74B497F1ADEF4AF0B1AD507DF7005A00.ashx" /><br /> What are some of the best dog treats for furry friends who love to chew? Long-lasting chew treats, of course! These tasty rewards keep dogs occupied and happy, offering everything a pup and their pet parent can ask for. They are also ideal for helping dogs fight boredom; for example, when you have a busy day working from home and can&rsquo;t give your best friend as much attention as usual!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Look for high-quality options such as Nylabone<sup>&reg;</sup> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/brand/nubz" target="_blank">Natural Nubz&trade;</a> chew treats. These USA-made, long-lasting chew treats are highly digestible and free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives for guiltless enjoyment.&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2>Natural Animal Parts&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> <p>It&rsquo;s simply in dogs&rsquo; nature to crave treats made from real animal parts such as bully sticks, beef hide, and pig ears. In addition to satisfying every dog&rsquo;s primal urge to chew, natural animal parts help clean teeth as dogs chew. These treats are typically long lasting, which keeps dogs occupied and helps <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-stop-dog-from-chewing" target="_blank">prevent destructive chewing</a>.
