        <br /><p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Searching for a furry friend who stays little for life? Well, the following dog breeds are among the tiniest&mdash;even when grown to their full, adult size. Featuring the most popular and less-than-common pups, our list of 10 tiny dog breeds under 10 pounds highlights what you should know about these sweet (and sometimes sassy!) shorties. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#1: Chihuahua</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;<img height="430" alt="Chihuahua" width="710" src="-/media/1A3A958BDDF446F49FEDB912FB49FA13.ashx" /></span>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;6&ndash;9 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;Up to 6 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Little in size but huge in heart, the lively </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/chihuahua" target="_blank"><span>Chihuahua</span></a> is considered one of the world&rsquo;s smallest breeds. In fact, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/4/a-history-of-the-biggest-and-smallest-dog-breeds-from-giant-great-danes-to-tiny" target="_blank"><span>Guinness World Record</span></a> for the shortest dog by height belongs to &ldquo;Miracle Milly,&rdquo; a Chihuahua from Puerto Rico. Another Chihuahua, &ldquo;Heaven Sent Brandy&rdquo; from Florida, holds the world record for the shortest dog by length. For reference, Brandy was about the same size as a dollar bill! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Chihuahuas&rsquo; coats come in a variety of colors and can be either short- or long-haired. The latter needs special attention&mdash;regular brushing, bathing, and trimming&mdash;while the short-haired is kept clean with occasional brushing. Because of their tiny size, it&rsquo;s not unusual to see Chihuahuas wearing sweaters to help keep them warm.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">The Chihuahua meets most of their exercise needs simply by following their pet parent around the house. With occasional bursts of energy throughout the day, Chihuahuas also need several play sessions. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#2: Pomeranian</span><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"> </span></h2> <img height="430" alt="Pomeranian " width="710" src="-/media/B5B980DFE27845188EA6DB69ED17749E.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;7&ndash;12 inches </span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;3&ndash;7 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><br /> The spunky </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/pomeranian" target="_blank"><span>Pomeranian</span></a> was named after the German province where the breed hails: Pomerania. The earliest Pom decedents weighed up to 30 pounds and didn&rsquo;t have the signature lion-like coat. However, once they made their way to North America, they eventually boasted their trademark size and fluffy fur.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">The Pom shares many characteristics with other spitz breeds, which are a type of dog bred for arctic climates. </span>Accordingly, they possess heavy double coats, along with almond-shaped eyes, pointy ears, and intelligent, active personalities.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">That eye-catching thick coat is especially prone to shedding, so brushing several times a week is recommended.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#3: Biewer Terrier</span></h2> <img height="430" alt="Biewer terrier with bow in hair " width="710" src="-/media/17D2EE0081E24B49BA15E07F7CD9FE82.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;7&ndash;11 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;4&ndash;8 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">At first glance, you may mistake a Biewer (pronounced &ldquo;Beaver&rdquo;) Terrier for a Yorkshire Terrier, but this cutie is officially one of AKC&rsquo;s recognized breeds as of 2021. Between its newcomer status and small litter size (which is common among tiny dog breeds), the breed is rare to find in U.S. households.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">So, what&rsquo;s the difference between the Biewer Terrier and the Yorkie? Its coat: the Biewer Terrier features three colors whereas the Yorkie has two colors. The Biewer Terrier has more white throughout its fur, plus a full tail that flows over their back versus the Yorkie&rsquo;s sparse tail.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Because their coats can grow to the ground, regular brushing is essential. Although they possess terrier-like qualities&mdash;particularly their hunting instincts&mdash;the loyal Biewer Terrier can most likely be found in their pet parent&rsquo;s lap!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#4: Toy Fox Terrier </span></h2> <img height="430" alt="Toy Fox Terrier" width="710" src="-/media/D3E10FCEFD774A76B425C6AA5D1151C4.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;8.5&ndash;11.5 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;4&ndash;9 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">The Toy Fox Terrier is a class act, and we mean it! These talented dogs historically performed in circus acts thanks to their impressive athleticism and agility. With similar qualities as their larger Fox Terrier ancestors&mdash;who assisted hunters in forcing foxes out of their dens&mdash;the toy terrier was originally bred to catch rats and other vermin in barnyards.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">This smart and playful pup is full of terrier-like energy, but doesn&rsquo;t enjoy rough play; therefore, they may not be best suited for households with small children.

They got their name from their signature butterfly-shaped ears (fun fact: the word &ldquo;papillon&rdquo; means &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; in French).</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">To prevent their long coat from matting and to assist with shed control, Papillons require frequent baths. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/chew-toys/moderate-chew/moderate-chew-flexichew-bone" target="_blank"><strong><span>SHOP: Big Fun for Tiny Dogs</span></strong></a></span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#6: Maltese</span></h2> <img height="430" alt="Maltese" width="710" src="-/media/F0415BCC3CA0428CB75C884D50DD2D75.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;7.5&ndash;10 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight</span></strong><span style="background: white;">: 6&ndash;9 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/maltese" target="_blank"><span>Maltese</span></a> may be short, but their history is <em>long</em>! Commonly found in the Mediterranean for thousands of years, this ancient breed originated on the small island of Malta, which is located off the southern coast of Italy. It&rsquo;s also believed that the Phoenicians&mdash;who sailed and traded around the known world&mdash;traveled with Maltese dogs to help protect their ships&rsquo; food rations from rodents.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Known to be gentle, loving, and trusting, the Maltese stays close to their pet parent, often trailing under their feet, sitting in their lap, or lounging in their arms. However, pet parents shouldn&rsquo;t spend <em>too </em>much time carrying around these tiny dogs; they still need to get in their daily walks for exercise!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">If you or someone in your household suffers from allergies, the Maltese can be a great choice! With no undercoat, the breed&rsquo;s white, silky coat doesn&rsquo;t shed much. However, because their coat is thinner and the skin is more visible, they are more prone to sunburn than other dogs. So, provide them plenty of shade if you&rsquo;re hanging outside for extended periods. Don&rsquo;t forget to use a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fourpaws.com/products/magic-coat-bright-whitening-shampoo-for-dogs" target="_blank"><span>whitening dog shampoo</span></a> to keep their coat looking its finest!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#7: Bolognese</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <img height="430" alt="Bolognese" width="710" src="-/media/3DC98553BDC644E88164E7FF8AE41B3D.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;10&ndash;12 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;6&ndash;10 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Also known as the Bichon Bolognese, this white furball reigns from the Italian city of Bolgna. The ancient breed dates back to the 13<sup>th</sup> century and has had some rather noble pet parents over the years, from Catherine the Great to Marilyn Monroe! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">They&rsquo;re attention-lovers, sensitive, and not very active, making them a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/10-best-dog-breeds-for-seniors" target="_blank"><span>great dog for older people</span></a>.

Ben&rsquo;s rugged hometown area was known for its hardworking coal miners and mill workers, who needed tough, </span><span style="background: white;">tiny dogs</span><span style="background: white;"> to keep vermin under control in the mines and textile mills. </span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Although the Chihuahua holds the titles of shortest dog by length and height, there was reportedly a dwarf Yorkie in the 1940s that was &ldquo;barely bigger than a human fist,&rdquo; according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/4/a-history-of-the-biggest-and-smallest-dog-breeds-from-giant-great-danes-to-tiny" target="_blank"><span>Guinness World Records</span></a>. This would make them the smallest dog ever on record!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">If opting to keep their Yorkie&rsquo;s coat long, pet parents should consider daily brushing and maybe even an adorable topknot to keep their dog&rsquo;s eyes hair-free. On the other hand, a short-clipped haircut keeps grooming simple.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">#9: Affenpinscher</span>&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><img height="430" alt="Affenpinscher" width="710" src="-/media/F08BC6E9D3034D9A91F9A5C5654FC54D.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><strong><span style="background: white;">Height:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp; 9&ndash;12 inches</span><br /> <strong><span style="background: white;">Weight:</span></strong><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;5&ndash;10 pounds</span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">One of the less common pedigree breeds, the Affenpinscher&rsquo;s name is derived from the word &ldquo;affeit,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; in German. Although the breed isn&rsquo;t classified as a terrier, they were bred to work like one, tasked with ridding rats from stables in the 1600s. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Only moderately active, these furry friends don&rsquo;t need a ton of activity and are great </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/10-dog-breeds-for-apartment-dwellers" target="_blank"><span>dogs for apartments and condos</span></a>.

Originating in Germany 700 years ago, these little dogs were initially bred as ratters to keep the rodent population at bay. They&rsquo;ve since grown in popularity in the U.S., and they are one of the most athletic little dogs you can find! </span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Often called the &ldquo;King of Toys&rdquo; (<em>toy breeds, </em>that is), these dogs are confident and assertive.
