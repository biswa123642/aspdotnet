        <br /><p style="margin-bottom: 7.5pt;">The weekend is coming, and the fun possibilities are endless! While cuddling on the couch is never a bad idea, you may be seeking more intriguing dog activities. We have you covered with our excitement-packed list of 8 unique things to do with your dog.</p> <h2>#1: See an Outdoor Movie</h2> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;">More and more cities are offering outdoor movie screenings&mdash;often even free of charge&mdash;at parks, beaches, or drive-in movie theaters. This is the perfect opportunity to sit on a blanket, snack on some popcorn, and catch a movie while your dog enjoys a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/edible-chew-treats" target="_blank"><span>chew treat</span></a> beside you. You can even play fetch or let your pup socialize with other dogs before the movie starts to expend a bit of their energy.</p> <h2>#2: Go Out to Dinner with Your Dog</h2> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;">Ever order delivery so you wouldn&rsquo;t have to leave your dog home alone? You don&rsquo;t have to order in every weekend; more restaurants and bars are allowing dogs in their outdoor eating areas. Many local spots even host &ldquo;Yappy Hours&rdquo; to welcome four-legged patrons! </p> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;">To make it a full evening of dog activities, you can take your pooch for a stroll downtown, enjoy some food and drinks, and hit the local park. Just remember to call ahead and make sure the restaurant can accommodate you and your pup. </p> <h2>#3: Go Camping </h2> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;">Hiking, enjoying nature, and warming up by a campfire are great things to do with your dog and a few friends or family members. Many campsites are pet-friendly, but of course a little research ahead of time is recommended. If your dog isn&rsquo;t accustomed to sleeping in a tent, try setting up a tent in the comfort of your own backyard as a fun test run for the real thing! Some campsites even offer cabin rentals if you&rsquo;d prefer instead of a tent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt; text-align: center;"><span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/going-camping-with-your-dog" target="_blank">RELATED: Tips for Going Camping with Your Dog</a></span></p> <h2>#4: Go to a Ball Game</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="baseball field" width="710" src="-/media/0B4EAC36D1DF41BB9A2708E46D7A9A04.ashx" /></p> <p>Get ready to have a real <em>ball </em>with your dog! Many minor league or local<span> sporting events allow pet parents to bring their dog on a leash. The major league stadiums, however, periodically schedule designated events when dogs are permitted to attend. For example, </span>Bark at the Park events allow you and your furry fan to attend Major League Baseball games and cheer on your favorite team together. Dog activities may include a<span> &ldquo;pup parade&rdquo; on the field before the game, visiting the sponsors&rsquo; booths, and enjoying the game from the stands. </span></p> <h2>#5: Go Out for a Sweet Treat</h2> <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;">Who doesn&rsquo;t love enjoying dessert after dinner? Although you should refrain from letting your dog sneak a taste of your ice-cream cone or cookie, you can seek out a local dog bakery, which are becoming increasingly more common! You&rsquo;ll be sure to find a biscuit, cookie, or even cake that looks amazing <em>and</em> is made with dog-friendly ingredients. Not to mention, your furry friend enjoying an elaborately decorated cookie sounds like the pawfect photo opportunity.</p> <h2>#6: Book a Pet-Friendly Rental Home</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="Two corgis laying on the front porch" width="710" src="-/media/784B504C8FC746709C30865C5A021571.ashx" /></p> <p>Turn your night out into an overnight out! Everyone loves an exciting change of scenery, and the things to do with your dog on a weekend getaway are endless. Nearly all travel websites have a &ldquo;pet-friendly&rdquo; category when you&rsquo;re browsing availabilities, making the research process simple. Whether it&rsquo;s a quaint beach house or a cabin near the mountains, your furry friend will appreciate the adventure.</p> <h2>#7: Visit an Indoor Dog Park</h2> <p>If it gets dark early or there&rsquo;s inclement weather, check out an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/must-visit-indoor-dog-parks" target="_blank">indoor dog park</a>! These locations are popping up across the U.S. and provide dogs a comfortable, fun place to socialize and exercise. Depending on where you visit, you will find a wide range of activities and amenities, such as swimming pools, playground equipment, tunnels, snack bars, and much more. </p> <h2>#8: Get the Paws Sandy!</h2> <p>Have you ever visited a beach or lake in the evening? <span>The sun is setting, the crowds have dispersed, and the temperatures have cooled. Dusk is a great time to enjoy the sandy shores with your furry friend.<span style="color: #333333;"> There&rsquo;s no better way to end the evening than </span></span>running in the sand and tossing your dog&rsquo;s favorite <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/play-toys">play toy</a>. Just make sure to check out the local rules. Many beaches welcome dogs in certain areas, set times of the day, or even times of the year.</p> <h2>Enjoy the Evening</h2> <p>We hope this fun list of dog activities inspires your plans for a night out with your furry friend! With so many things to do with your dog, the possibilities for adventures and quality bonding time are boundless.</p>
