        <br /><p> While you may associate spring and summer with peaceful fun in the sun, your dog may experience just the opposite: sound phobias associated with thunderstorms, which are typical that time of year. Being scared of thunderstorms is quite common in dogs and may result in drooling and panting excessively, pacing, barking, whining, or even harming themselves trying to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the terrifying sounds. </p> <h2>Why Your Dog Is Sound Sensitive </h2> <h3> He&rsquo;s Been Traumatized in the Past</h3> <p> A dog who has experienced a fearful event in the past is more likely to react negatively to future events. For example, if your pup was startled by an unexpected firework last 4th of July, he may associate that sound with all fireworks. </p> <h3> He&rsquo;s Not Socialized Well Enough</h3> <p> Dogs should be socialized from a young age to experience a variety of people, places, things, AND sounds. Often people don&rsquo;t realize that puppies aren&rsquo;t born recognizing all the strange noises in their environment. The best time to sensitize your puppy to different sounds is between three and eight weeks of age. Various CDs on the market play fireworks and thunder; just begin slowly and only gradually increase the volume and length of time. </p> <h3> His Sensitivity Has Become Generalized</h3> <p> If your dog is already sensitive to a certain noise, like the vacuum cleaner, it can spread to fear of other strange or loud noises, such as a booming thunderstorm. </p> <h2> How to Manage Sound Sensitivity </h2> <h3>Socialize and Desensitize Your Dog </h3> <p>It&rsquo;s never too late to gently expose him to the world&mdash;just don&rsquo;t force it. Don&rsquo;t drag him to a boisterous summertime parade on the first day of training. Instead, slowly but surely introduce him to new sights and sounds, which will ensure that he feels secure. This way you are gradually desensitizing him to his environment&mdash;but keep in mind that this will take lots of time and patience. Your dog won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;cured&rdquo; overnight. </p> <h3>Provide Sound Therapy</h3> <p>Whether you use a CD of sounds mentioned earlier or even turn on some <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/do-dogs-like-music" target="_blank">calming dog music</a> during a storm or firework event, sound therapy can greatly reduce your dog&rsquo;s stress levels. When used during an actual sound event, music may help drown out any undesirable noise. </p> <h3>Consider Other Remedies </h3> <p> Depending on the severity of your dog&rsquo;s sound phobia, one or more of these may help. Some herbal remedies induce muscle relaxation, and vet-prescribed medications generate a calming effect. Pheromone therapy uses naturally secreted pheromones to lessen the negative side effects associated with sound phobias. </p> <h3> Hire a Behaviorist</h3> <p> With a serious sound sensitivity, a behaviorist is often the best person to help train your dog&mdash;and maybe even more importantly, you&mdash;to deal with the problem. Intense fears can lead to aggression, so it&rsquo;s crucial that you tackle the problem head-on. </p> <br />
