        <br /><p>Allergies have become a huge problem for both animals and humans. Allergies specific to dogs are grouped into four categories: flea, atopic or inhalant, food, and contact.</p> <h2>Flea</h2> <p>The flea allergy is the most common type. It isn’t an allergy to actual fleas but to a protein in flea saliva that is left in the skin after a flea bite. Severe reactions to this allergy can really depress your dog, so you should ask your veterinarian for ways to keep this allergy under control.</p> <h2>Inhalants</h2> <p>Inhalant allergies are the second most common type of allergy in dogs. They occur when a dog breathes in certain allergens, such as pollen, tobacco smoke, or mold spores. Talk to a veterinarian for treatment suggestions.</p> <h2>Food</h2> <p>Dogs are often allergic to the same foods that humans are allergic to, such as soy, milk, eggs, wheat, or corn. Usually a dog’s reaction to a food allergy is itchy, irritated skin, but some may respond with vomiting or diarrhea. It may take some time and effort to figure out exactly what your dog is allergic to, but once you know, it shouldn’t be too difficult to adjust his diet. Nylabone has a variety of <a href="http://www.nylabone.com/product-finder/by-brand/healthy-edibles-corn-wheat-free.htm"> Corn-and Wheat-Free edible dog products</a>.</p> <h2>Contact Allergies</h2> <p>When a dog has contact allergies, a reaction occurs when he physically touches a substance that contains an allergen, such as plastic, grass, or wool. Contact allergies usually require regular allergy shots to keep them under control, and lifestyle changes may also be necessary.</p> <br>
