      Value: "<br /><p> Dog&rsquo;s eyes and ears are an important, and often overlooked, aspect of their overall health. Properly caring for your dog&rsquo;s eyes and ears can prevent painful infections from developing. Here are a few of the basics for proper eye and ear cleaning for your dog. </p> <h2> How to Clean Your Dog&rsquo;s Eyes </h2> <p> Like humans, dog&rsquo;s eyes are sensitive and should be cleaned on a regular basis. Dogs are susceptible to many of the same eye conditions that are common in humans, including styes, allergies, and infections. </p> <h3> Cleaning Tearstains </h3> <p> Many light-colored dogs can develop brown tearstains underneath their eyes, usually caused by excess fluid that wets the fur around the eyes and allows various yeasts to flourish. The best way to avoid these tearstains is to keep your dog clean and keep the hair out of his eyes. There are also a number of commercial tearstain removers that you can use. </p> <h3> Cleaning Discharge</h3> <p> A healthy dog may have a clear mucus around his eyes. This is normal and should be wiped away with a soft, damp cloth. </p> <h3> Signs of Infection</h3> <p> If the secretion is yellowish or bloody, your dog should be taken to the veterinarian right away, as this could be a sign of infection. </p> <h2> How to Clean Your Dog&rsquo;s Ears </h2> <h3> Remove Excess Hair</h3> <p> Dogs with a lot of hair, such as Poodles, tend to accumulate some hair growth in the ear canal. This hair must be removed on a regular basis, ideally about once a week. Use ear powder to stiffen the hair before easily pulling it out. </p> <h3> Clean Out Dirt</h3> <p> All dogs, short-haired, long-haired, or somewhere in between, should have their ears cleaned regularly with a cotton ball dipped in alcohol or a dog-ear-cleaning solution. </p> <h3>Signs of Infection </h3> <p>If your dog develops an ear problem, he should exhibit certain symptoms. He may frequently shake his head, rub his ears on the floor, or scratch his ear with his foot. If you recognize these symptoms, look inside his ears. If they are red or have a discharge, there may be an inflammation or infection, and <strong>you and your pup should visit the vet as soon as possible. </strong></p> <br> <br>"
