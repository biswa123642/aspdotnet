Whether you have a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hike&rdquo; furry friend or a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s chill&rdquo; pup, these low-fat snacks are a wholesome way to support their lifestyle.&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/choosing-the-right-food-for-your-dog" target="_blank">&rarr; RELATED: Choosing the Right Food for Your Dog</a></h1> <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> <h2>Wholesome Homemade Dog Treats&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="woman cooking with dog" width="710" src="-/media/8EAE0613605541F8941540FF579278F0.ashx" /><br /> <br /> Your dog loves to be spoiled just as much as you enjoy spoiling them! For those times when you want to do something extra-special for your furry friend, roll up your sleeves and surprise them by making one of these nutritious homemade dog treats.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Peanut Terrifics<sup>i</sup></h3> <p>What pooch doesn&rsquo;t love peanut butter? Peanut Terrifics make great <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/dog-behavior-solutions/training-and-rewards#facets=Product%20Type:Edible%20Chew%20Treats" target="_blank">training and reward treats</a> that are heavy on flavor and light on calories. Just be sure to stay away from peanut butter that contains xylitol (also known as birch sugar), which is a chemical compound that&rsquo;s highly toxic to dogs. Natural, unsalted peanut butter is best for your pup.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:&nbsp;</strong></p> <ul>     <li>&frac12; cup water&nbsp;</li>     <li>3 tablespoons dog-friendly peanut butter&nbsp;</li>     <li>1 &frac14; cups whole wheat flour&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>Instructions:&nbsp;</strong><br /> Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F. Then mix all the ingredients thoroughly in a bowl together. Spread the doughy mixture evenly on a baking sheet and cut into desired shapes such as dog bones or pawprints. Bake for 30 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Jumping for Jerky<sup>ii</sup>&nbsp;</h3> <p>Your furry friend doesn&rsquo;t have to be a trailblazer to enjoy this rustic snack! Blackstrap molasses adds a naturally sweet <em>and </em>healthy twist to this homemade jerky treat, containing iron and calcium. The jerky takes 4&ndash;5 hours to dehydrate, so this is something you&rsquo;ll want to prepare well in advance of your dog&rsquo;s snack time.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:&nbsp;</strong></p> <ul>     <li>&frac14; cup blackstrap molasses&nbsp;</li>     <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary&nbsp;</li>     <li>1 lb. lamb or venison, sliced into thin strips along the grain with fat removed&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>Instructions:&nbsp;</strong><br /> Combine the molasses and rosemary in a large bowl. Add the meat and stir, making sure it is all covered with the marinade. Leave to marinate 1&ndash;2 hours in the refrigerator. Then line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Lay the marinated meat strips on the wire rack and brush with the remaining marinade. Preheat your oven to 225&deg;F and let the jerky cook for 4&ndash;5 hours. Allow the jerky to cool and store for up to 5&ndash;7 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Healthy Fruits and Vegetables for Dogs&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="430" alt="dog eating strawberry" width="710" src="-/media/895C0A4E1EF04B9CAD3B10E10FE206A2.ashx" /><br /> <br /> When you don&rsquo;t have any pup-specific snacks on hand, fruits and veggies make excellent healthy dog snacks in a pinch. These go-to favorites are great for pooches and people alike!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Apples&nbsp;</h3> <p>High in fiber and vitamins A and C, apples are a quintessential healthy dog snack. Plus, their low fat content makes them a great treat for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/managing-dog-weight-issues" target="_blank">dog weight management</a>. Don&rsquo;t forget to remove the seeds and core before feeding apple slices to your dog.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Cantaloupe&nbsp;</h3> <p>This sweet melon is another great low-calorie snack for furry friends. Cantaloupe is particularly high in fiber, which aids in digestion. It does have a lot of sugar, though, so be sure to feed in moderation.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Oranges&nbsp;</h3> <p>A refreshing and citrusy snack, oranges are loaded with vitamin C, fiber, and potassium. Just be sure to remove the peel before giving to your dog.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Strawberries&nbsp;</h3> <p>Not only are strawberries delicious to dogs, they are great for your fur pal&rsquo;s immune system! They also contain antioxidants and potassium, both of which are important to overall health.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Watermelon&nbsp;</h3> <p>A refreshing piece of watermelon is a great way to help hydrate your dog on a hot day, offering vitamins A, B6, and C. Choose a seedless variety for your pooch and remove the rind, which could lead to gastrointestinal upset.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3> Brussels Sprouts&nbsp;</h3> <p>These crunchy, leafy snacks are some of the healthiest vegetables for dogs! Brussels sprouts contain vitamins K and C, which are beneficial to a dog&rsquo;s immune system and bone health, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rover.com/blog/can-dogs-eat-brussel-sprouts/" target="_blank">Rover</a>. Serving Brussels sprouts raw can cause digestive problems; instead, steam or boil them for your best friend.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Carrots&nbsp;</h3> <p>Speaking of crunchy veggies, carrots are another popular pick among dogs. Furry friends love their crisp texture, which can actually help clean teeth as your dog chews, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/fruits-vegetables-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a>. High fiber and beta-carotene content headline carrots&rsquo; nutritional value for pups.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Celery&nbsp;</h3> <p>Dogs can eat celery raw or cooked, giving your furry friend a few ways to enjoy this wholesome treat. It contains vitamins A, C, and K plus potassium and folate&hellip;and it&rsquo;s fat free! Celery can also help clean teeth as your dog chews, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.healthypawspetinsurance.com/can-dogs-eat-celery" target="_blank">Healthy Paws Pet Insurance</a>.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Green Beans&nbsp;</h3> <p>What makes green beans a nutritious vegetable for dogs? These classic veggies offer iron, calcium, protein, fiber, and a variety of vitamins! Serve them to your dog plain and avoid canned green beans with added salt, oils, or spices.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <h2>Healthy Is Happy!&nbsp;</h2> <p>Wholesome snacking isn&rsquo;t limited to bland, boring foods. In fact, the list of deliciously healthy snacks for pups is as robust and well-rounded as the beneficial ingredients they contain. Your fur pal will thank you for choosing these tasty treats!&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Sources<br /> </strong><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun BlobObject DragDrop SCXW162788472 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="Superscript SCXW162788472 BCX0" data-fontsize="10" style="background-color: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>i</em></span></span><em><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" data-ccp-parastyle="endnote text" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" data-ccp-parastyle="endnote text" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> Jonna Anne, Mary Straus, and Shawn Messonnier,&nbsp;</span></span><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" data-ccp-parastyle="endnote text" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Healthy Dog Cookbook</span></span></em><span data-contrast="auto" class="TextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" style="background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #000000;"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW162788472 BCX0" data-ccp-parastyle="endnote text" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>&nbsp;(Neptune City: T.F.H.
