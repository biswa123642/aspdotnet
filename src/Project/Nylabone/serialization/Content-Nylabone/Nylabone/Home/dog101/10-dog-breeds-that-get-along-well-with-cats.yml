        <br />It&rsquo;s no secret that cats and dogs have a long-standing reputation as archenemies. But the truth is cat and dog siblings can happily live together or even become best buddies. Maybe you have a feline and want to welcome a dog into the family, or perhaps you have a dog and want a new kitty. Either way, supervised introductions along with learning <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-dogs-and-cats-can-coexist" target="_blank">how dogs and cats can coexist</a> will help socialize and accustom these pets to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <h2>How Different Dog Breed Groups Interact with Cats&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> Although properly introducing your pets to each other can go a long way, certain dog breed groups demonstrate instinctive behaviors, which may affect how they tend to get along with cats.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For instance, dogs in the Terrier Group were historically bred to hunt, and the Hound Group includes some naturally determined chasers, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/dogs-that-are-good-with-cats/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a>. Therefore, a running cat can spark this predatory impulse. Similarly, the Herding Group was trained to gather and protect livestock&mdash;and cats may not appreciate this group&rsquo;s instinctual tendency to corral other animals they encounter.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> On the other hand, dog breed groups known for having low energy or easygoing personalities typically mesh the best with cats. For example, the Toy Group includes lapdogs who make great furry siblings because of their sociable nature, and the Sporting Group includes many breeds known for their friendly disposition around humans and animals alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that these dog breeds groups&rsquo; personalities are generalizations; there are plenty of breeds within all the groups that can make great furry siblings! Explore these ten dog breeds that particularly get along well with cats. Be sure to keep in mind that the individual personalities of both the dog and cat play a role in the relationship, too.&nbsp;<br /> <h2>#1: Golden Retriever&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="590" alt="golden-retriever" width="975" src="-/media/2821874BC23B4218A5E2F5EC019EEE86.ashx" /></p> <p>Golden Retrievers are one of the best dogs for cats, and &ldquo;golden&rdquo; is a fitting word to describe this classic breed. Kind and empathetic, Golden Retrievers accept cats readily as part of the family. However, this dog breed should be trained to not chase after the kitty early on. Once that is accomplished, the happy-go-lucky Golden Retriever and cat are sure to be a perfect match. Plus, this dog breed is innately amiable to other people and pets!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Read on about the gentle <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/golden-retriever" target="_blank">Golden Retriever</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>#2: Labrador Retriever&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="590" alt="black-labrador-retriever" width="975" src="-/media/7416462F2159442A831B898D123D4737.ashx" /></p> <p>The exuberant Labrador Retriever, or &ldquo;Lab,&rdquo; is a lover&mdash;not a fighter. They will happily welcome a cat into their circle of friends. Along with befriending your cat, the Lab is a gentle giant who will make an ideal companion for your children. Though Labs are not the jealous type and are more than willing to share their space with the cat, the cat must be willing to share their space with the dog as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Find out more about the patient <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/labrador-retriever" target="_blank">Labrador Retriever</a>.&nbsp;</p> <h2>#3: Beagle&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="590" alt="beagle" width="975" src="-/media/4B85A75D6CDD4FA7ADCDA238BE9CFE19.ashx" /></p> <p>The amiable Beagle seems to enjoy feline company&mdash;perhaps because it was bred to hunt in packs. Therefore, it views a cat sibling as a fellow member of the group. Stick to one Beagle, though; together, these dogs may acquire a &ldquo;pack mentality&rdquo; and are more likely to team up on the cat, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.beaglepro.com/beagles-and-cats" target="_blank">BeaglePro</a>.

However, the cat can be the one to take advantage of a Maltese&rsquo;s sweet and gentle personality. On that note, these two can live peacefully if the kitty agrees not to tease the Maltese, such as playing with this dog breed&rsquo;s long hair. Therefore, be sure to keep a close watch when introducing your kitty to your Maltese and they will get along just fine!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Learn more about the charming <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/maltese" target="_blank">Maltese</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>#10: Boston Terrier&nbsp;</h2> <p><img height="590" alt="boston-terrier" width="975" src="-/media/F53C95E1D1C54DC498B4B9B510B34559.ashx" /></p> <p>While Terriers are not typically compatible with cats, we can make an exception for this gentleman: the Boston Terrier, or &ldquo;Boston.&rdquo; Although Bostons may engage in chasing the cat, this is usually out of fun, not prey drive.
