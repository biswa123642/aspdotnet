        <br /><p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Your dog&rsquo;s sense of smell is nothing to sneeze at! If your pup loves to sniff pretty much<em> everything</em>, you probably won&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that smell is their strongest sense. But just how powerful are those doggy nostrils? Keep reading to discover what makes dogs&rsquo; noses so sensitive, how furry friends use their remarkable smelling abilities, and which dogs have the best sense of smell.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs&rsquo; Sense of Smell Vs. Humans&rsquo; Sense of Smell</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">When it comes to sniffing skills, our furry companions have a big advantage over us. A typical dog&rsquo;s nose contains 300 million odor receptors, compared to about 6 million in a human&rsquo;s nose, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rd.com/list/things-dogs-can-smell-that-humans-cant/" target="_blank"><em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</em></a>. The part of the canine brain that interprets odors is also much larger than that of the human brain. Pooches&rsquo; sense of smell is so much better than ours that some dogs can even detect a teaspoon of sugar in a body of water the size of two Olympic swimming pools, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6622613/Medical-alert-dogs-detect-TEASPOON-sugar-two-Olympic-sized-swimming-pools.html" target="_blank"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. It&rsquo;s no wonder so many dogs and their keen noses specialize in police and detective work!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">How Do Dogs Use Their Sense of Smell?</span></h2> &nbsp;<img height="430" alt="2 dogs smelling each other" width="710" src="-/media/A52467CA403E4F869AB4BE4250A7668F.ashx" /> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">While talking is our main way of conversing, dogs have a unique &ldquo;scent language&rdquo; to communicate with and learn about other dogs. Ever notice how your dog &ldquo;greets&rdquo; a new furry friend with a sniff or two? It may seem like an awkward way to say hello, but sniffing teaches your pooch essential information about the other dog such as their gender, their age, where they&rsquo;ve been, and what they&rsquo;ve eaten recently.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Getting a good whiff of you or another animal can even help dogs understand mood. If your pup always seems to comfort you when you&rsquo;re upset, that&rsquo;s because they can smell your stress. Our bodies release hormones and chemicals when we feel emotions like fear or anxiety, which dogs can detect through their nose. Your dog truly knows you like nobody else!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/science-behind-sounds-only-dogs-can-hear" target="_blank"><strong><span>RELATED: The Science Behind Sounds Only Dogs Can Hear</span></strong></a></span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">How Far Can Dogs Smell?</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Furry friends not only have an incredible sense of smell, but they can also sniff out objects from great distances. Exactly how far dogs can smell depends on a wide range of factors including breed, weather conditions, and the specific scent they are tracking. Wind blowing toward a dog, for example, can make objects that are farther away more &ldquo;visible&rdquo; to their nose. Likewise, an item with a potent smell is easier to sense than something with a very mild smell. Under perfect conditions, dogs have been reported to smell objects or people from up to 20 kilometers (about 12.4 miles) away, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://set.adelaide.edu.au/news/list/2020/06/09/how-far-away-can-dogs-smell-and-hear" target="_blank">University of Adelaide</a>!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs with the Best Sense of Smell</span></h2> <img height="430" alt="german shepherd puppy sniffing" width="710" src="-/media/54FD8452CBBD4B9CA9EA6A002682AD49.ashx" />&nbsp; <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">All dog breeds have a superb sense of smell, but some have especially perceptive noses. From natural-born hunters to pups who excel at search-and-rescue work, here are some of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/top-10-dog-breeds-in-america" target="_blank">most popular dogs</a> with the best sense of smell:</span></p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Beagle</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Belgian Malinois</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Bloodhound</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dachshund</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">German Shepherd</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Golden Retriever</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Labrador Retriever</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Scottish Terrier</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">How to Stimulate Your Dog&rsquo;s Strongest Sense</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs are curious creatures! In addition to helping your fur pal learn about their world, smelling provides mental stimulation. Let them stop and sniff around trees and fire hydrants for a few moments on your next walk; the scents they pick up can teach them information about other dogs in the neighborhood while keeping their mind busy.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Giving your pooch long-lasting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/products/product-type/chew-toys" target="_blank">dog chew toys</a> is another great way to arouse their sense of smell. Chewing and sniffing <em>both</em> provide mental stimulation, so an occupying toy&rsquo;s aroma will give your pup&rsquo;s brain some extra exercise as they chew. While Nylabone&reg; chew toys are odorless to humans, dogs can smell their irresistible flavor!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Sniffing Is a Superpower!</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #3f3f3f;">Dogs have some of the finest smelling abilities in the animal kingdom, bested only by sharks, bears, and a small handful of other creatures. Keep that in mind the next time your furry friend&rsquo;s nose suddenly drops to the ground&mdash;they may be sniffing out something that&rsquo;s miles away!</span></p> <span style="color: #3f3f3f;"> Dogs&rsquo; sense of smell is beyond compare, but how does their vision stack up?
