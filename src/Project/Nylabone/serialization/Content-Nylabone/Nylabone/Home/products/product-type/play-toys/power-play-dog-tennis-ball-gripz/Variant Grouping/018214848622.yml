        Power up playtime with Power Play Dog Toys from Nylabone! The bright and bouncy Tennis Ball Gripz is ideal for pet parents looking for an exciting and fresh take on classic tennis balls for dogs. Strategically designed with our four-legged friends in mind, this dog toy ball offers a unique indented shape that makes it easier for dogs to pick up and carry in their mouths compared to an ordinary tennis ball. Plus, the flat side of the ball means it stays put once it stops rolling so your dog can grab-and-go with ease. Made of soft material that is gentle on teeth, this yellow dog toy is highly visible to see in all sorts of play settings. Whether you’re in the grass or on a solid surface, the erratic bouncing action is sure to fascinate your pup! Does your furry play buddy love squeaky dog toys? The Tennis Ball Gripz includes a protected squeaker for added durability and extra fun. Simply squeeze the ball and release it as you throw for an exciting mid-air squeal that will thrill your dog during a game of fetch! Grip better, bounce crazier, and play harder with the Original Tennis Ball Gripz!
