        <h3>About American Humane and the Pups4Patriots&trade; Program</h3>
        <p>Founded in 1877, American Humane&rsquo;s core mission is to be the &ldquo;first to serve&rdquo; wherever animals are in need of rescue, shelter, protection, or security, and to nurture the bond between animals and humans. Pups4Patriots&trade; serves both goals by pairing rescue dogs in need of homes with veterans in need of service animals.</p>
        <p>The lives of thousands of veterans and shelter dogs are lost each year. American Humane and the Pups4Patriots&trade; program is working to save lives&mdash;on both ends of the leash&mdash;by rescuing surrendered dogs and training them as life-saving service dogs for military veterans struggling with the invisible wounds of war, such as PTSD and traumatic brain injury.</p>
        <p>You can help too! Join Nylabone in our support for the American Humane and Pups4Patriots&trade; program.</p>
