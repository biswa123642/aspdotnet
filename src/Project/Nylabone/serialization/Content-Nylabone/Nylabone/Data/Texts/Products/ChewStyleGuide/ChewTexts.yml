        <h3>Puppy Chews</h3>
        <p>The puppy stage is a critical opportunity for teaching your pup good chewing habits. Puppies use their mouths to explore their surroundings, play, and especially relieve teething discomfort. Our Puppy Chews come in all different shapes, flavors, and textures to keep your new best friend comforted and entertained—from classic bone shapes to unique keys and rings! With positive reinforcement, pups will learn that chewing on Nylabone Puppy Chews is not only encouraged, but a fun pastime as they grow and develop.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Moderate Chews</h3>
        <p>All dogs have the natural instinct to chew—some simply have a less intense chewing style. Moderate Chew FlexiChews are the perfect fit for senior dogs or just gentler chewers who enjoy some flex and give. Made of softer, flexible material and available in many shapes and flavors, these chew toys give moderate chewers a safe, fun activity while discouraging destructive chewing. Plus, they help clean teeth while dogs chew!</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Strong Chews</h3>
        <p>Our Strong Chews are made of a tougher variety of materials and are perfect for the average chewer. With many options made of natural rubber, these chew toys still have some flex and give and are easier for dogs to grip. Available in a variety of textures, flavors, and shapes to choose from, each chew discourages destructive chewing habits while providing an independent pastime for dogs who enjoy a good chewing session. No matter which Strong Chew your dog enjoys, the natural chewing action also helps clean teeth!</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Power Chews</h3>
        <p>Our Power Chew DuraChews are the ultimate long-lasting activity for extreme chewers. These durable nylon chew toys are built to withstand intense chewing and come in tons of flavors, sizes, shapes, and textures, so there’s an option for every dog to enjoy. In addition to helping clean teeth as dogs chew, they provide a safe, independent activity that fights boredom, prevents destructive chewing, and keeps dogs happy!</p>
