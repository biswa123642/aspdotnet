        <p>Nylabone sponsored the reunification of U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Dustin Reed with his retired military working dog, Anjin. After multiple deployments apart, the pair reunited on Sept. 11 in Venice, Italy—where SSgt Reed is stationed—and will now share a home together.</p>
        <p>“We’re immensely appreciative of everyone who serves in our military, and that includes four-legged members,” said Glen S. Axelrod, President and CEO of Nylabone<span>®</span>&nbsp;Products. “The companionship SSgt Reed and Anjin provide each other is irreplaceable, and we are honored to help them reunite as they begin a new, exciting chapter together.”</p>
        <p>Nylabone’s monetary donation supported Anjin’s transportation to Venice, Italy, as well as veterinarian services and subsequent care. SSgt Reed has served with the U.S. Air Force since 2009 and is also a K-9 trainer. Describing it as “love at first sight,” he met Anjin, an eight-year-old Belgian Malinois, while attending a K-9 Trainers course at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.</p>
        <p>SSgt Reed adopted Anjin in 2017 and looks forward to finally spending an extended amount of time with his dog, properly caring for her and providing the retirement she deserves. "American Humane remains steadfast in our commitment to providing for military K-9s and bringing them home to the handlers and families who love them most," said Dr. Robin Ganzert, President &amp; CEO of American Humane.</p>
        <p>Nylabone’s contribution supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.central.com/about-us/csr-strategy">Central Garden &amp; Pet’s Impact strategy</a>, which is dedicated to making positive changes through philanthropic work, focusing on community health, employee well-being, and sustainability.</p>
