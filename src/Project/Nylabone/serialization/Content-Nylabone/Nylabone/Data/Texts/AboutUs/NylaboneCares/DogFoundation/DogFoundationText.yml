        <p>Dogs have their own special power to provide us safety and companionship when we need it most. That's why Nylabone is proud to donate chew toys to future service dogs raised through the Guide Dog Foundation and America’s VetDogs®. These not-for-profit organizations train and place assistance dogs to provide independence, enhanced mobility and companionship to individuals who are blind or have low vision, and with veterans and first responders with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Nylabone chew toys offer relief and comfort to these hard-working dogs, especially as they train to be a service animal. Chewing helps ease their stress and anxiety so that they can do the same for the humans they support each day!</p>
        <p>Every dog we help in turn provides someone in need with greater independence and mobility. We are honored to work with these two wonderful organizations—helping to build relationships between dogs and people is at the heart of what we do!</p>
