        <p>At Nylabone, we cherish the joy dogs give us and believe every pup deserves a loving home. We also understand that dogs love to chew, and it&rsquo;s their natural way to cope with issues such as stress, separation anxiety, and boredom. That&rsquo;s why it is our mission to promote healthy, non-destructive behavior so dogs can safely satisfy their innate urge to chew&mdash;and avoid destroying other belongings!</p>
        <p>Nylabone Cares donates high-quality, durable chew toys to shelter dogs, service animals training to be lifesaving companions, and other canines preparing for a new life and family. In addition, we are committed to educating pet parents on why dogs chew and how to establish &amp; maintain healthy chewing habits&mdash;which is especially important for dogs adjusting to new homes.</p>
        <p>Whether our chew toys are comforting hard-working service animals, entertaining shelter dogs as they wait to be adopted, or easing a pup&rsquo;s anxiety as they transition to a new environment, Nylabone is dedicated to helping our furry friends find and stay in their forever homes!</p>
