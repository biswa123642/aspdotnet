        <p>We understand that choosing a fire ant killer can be overwhelming — especially when you have children or pets under threat of fire ant bites and stings. Options available through online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores can seem endless. You need to feel confident that the product you buy can do the job without adding stress to fire ant season. </p>
        <p>Fire ant killers fall into two main categories: <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C9CBC6FBA68D4D79ADD4CDDAC832607F&amp;_z=z">contact killers and fire ant baits</a>. Both types can be highly effective, so personal preferences carry some weight. Like the names suggest, contact killers kill fire ants by contact after ants touch the killer and spread it through the mound. Baits work by attracting fire ants that mistake the bait for food. They take it back to other ants and their queen, which ultimately kills the whole colony. Whether you choose contact killers or bait killers, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=100C6CDE07C842898E2402E2E4C16BB6&amp;_z=z">killing the queen</a>&nbsp;is essential to success. </p>
        <p>Once you get past the main differences between fire ant baits and contact killers, many other factors go into choosing the best fire ant killer for you. Considerations that rank high for us include effectiveness in killing the entire colony, how fast the product works, how long protection lasts, ease of application, quality of label instructions and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5777FB0C397044708AB187D571E49994&amp;_z=z">precautions for pets</a>&nbsp;and kids. Economy and brand reputation figure in there, too. </p>
        <p>To help make your choice a little easier, we took a look at leading fire ant killers to see how they stack up. With the above criteria in mind, we present the Best Fire Ant Killers of 2022: </p>
