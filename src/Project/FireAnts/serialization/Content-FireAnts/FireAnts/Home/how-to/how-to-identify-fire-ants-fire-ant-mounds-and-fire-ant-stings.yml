        <h2 id="FireAnts">How to Identify Fire Ants</h2>
        <p>The United States has several native fire ant species, but red imported fire ants are the ones behind your worries. These invasive South American natives were accidentally introduced to Alabama nearly 100 years ago. Since then, red imported fire ants spread through the Southeast and moved north, west and south. </p>
        <p>
        Geography is your first clue in identifying red imported fire ants. If you live in the southern United States, from the Carolinas west through Texas, you're in prime fire ant territory. Fire ants have spread to parts of the Southwest and California as well. If you live in the northern states, red imported fire ants aren't your problem. But that may change as their range expands. </p>
        <p>
        Getting close enough to fire ants to make a visual ID can be hazardous. But these physical characteristics help identify red imported fire ants: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reddish-brown color, often with darker red-brown to black-brown abdomens. </li>
            <li>Size variations of worker ants from 1/16 to 1/4 inch long.<sup> 1</sup>(Most ants have consistent sizes.) </li>
            <li>Narrow, pinched waists with two prominent nodes right before the abdomen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ant behavior is also key to fire ant identification. When mounds are disturbed, red imported fire ants swarm up anything vertical &mdash; including grass, twigs and outstretched arms or legs of people or pets. Other types of ants move slower and go out, not up.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Fire ant close up" src="-/media/D241699ED3E94EBEBF77B70AA3019AD1.ashx" />
            <figcaption>Red imported fire ants have two large bumps right before their abdomens. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2 id="Mounds">How to Identify Fire Ant Mounds</h2>
        <p>Fire ants usually build their mounds in open, sunny areas. The fluffy mounds often pop up right after rainfall or in nicely irrigated lawns. Unlike other types of ant mounds, undisturbed fire ant mounds don't have any visible entry or exit holes. A mound with a distinct center hole is not a fire ant mound. </p>
        <p>
        In well-maintained lawns, fire ant mounds stay relatively small and just a few inches high. In open pastures or unmaintained areas, fire ant mounds often reach 18 inches tall or more. Fire ant colonies nest deeper during times of heat and drought, so mounds may stay hidden from view. </p>
        <p>
        Red imported fire ant colonies can have a single queen or multiple queens. The more queens a colony has, the more mounds they form. Left unchecked, severe fire ant infestations can involve hundreds of mounds per acre, housing tens of millions of fire ants.<sup>2 </sup> But even large mounds can relocate quickly. </p>
        <p>
        Always be extremely cautious around potential fire ant mounds &mdash; even when armed with a long shovel or stick. Red imported fire ants flood out of disturbed mounds, ready to attack. They can run up long tool handles much faster than most people imagine.</p>

            <figcaption>Undamaged fire ant mounds are fluffy piles without visible entry or exit holes. </figcaption>

        <h2 id="Stings">How to Identify Fire Ant Stings</h2>
        <p>If you're stung by a fire ant, you'll probably know what type of ant is behind your pain. Before fire ants sting, they bite to get a firm grip. Then they sting repeatedly. The swarm of ants seems to bite all at once.</p>
        <p>
        The stinging sensation that inspired fire ant's name is often compared to putting a burning match to your skin. Within a day or so, fire ant sting sites develop large, white, fluid-filled pustules &mdash; unique to fire ant venom. If broken open, the sites often become infected and lead to scars. </p>
        <p>
        Only about 1% of the population has life-threatening reactions to fire ant venom, but extensive stings put anyone at risk.<sup> 1</sup>Young children and small animals, including pets, are especially vulnerable. If you're stung by a fire ant, make sure someone else knows. If you start to sweat heavily or feel short of breath, seek medical attention immediately. </p>
        <p>When you live in the southern United States, dealing with existing fire ants and new fire ant invasions comes with the territory. But by learning how to identify fire ants &mdash; and their mounds and stings &mdash; you can find  <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=86F476B790914F45A232A16B8A2B158D&amp;_z=z">the best fire ant killer</a>&nbsp;to protect your property and  <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=100C6CDE07C842898E2402E2E4C16BB6&amp;_z=z">kill invasive fire ants</a>&nbsp;and their colonies.</p>
