        <p>
        When you live in areas plagued with fire ants, it pays to be prepared with knowledge and effective control products.
        If you just moved into fire ant country, take time to learn how to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C315B85383442519372607FC6495BE1&amp;_z=z">identify fire ants, fire ant mounds and fire
        ant stings</a>&nbsp;so you know what's ahead. Mounds can pop up without warning when fire ants move in from
        neighbors' yards or suddenly reveal their colony has been living in your lawn. </p>
        <p>
        That's where fire ant killers, including mound treatments like Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules,
        come in. This fast-acting product is intended to treat fire ant mounds and reach deep in your lawn to kill the fire
        ant queen, which is essential to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=100C6CDE07C842898E2402E2E4C16BB6&amp;_z=z">getting rid of
        the entire fire ant colony</a>. </p>
        <h2 id="Performance">Performance: Works fast, reaches deep</h2>
        <p>
        Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules are designed for use as a mound treatment only, so you'll only
        find instructions for treating fire ant mounds on the bag. This product's active ingredient is lambda-cyhalothrin,
        which works to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C9CBC6FBA68D4D79ADD4CDDAC832607F&amp;_z=z">kill fire ants by
        contact</a>. Like other contact killers, this product only kills the ants that come in contact with the active
        ingredient. That can be through direct contact with the product or contact with treated ants. </p>
        <p>
        This product formula includes what Spectracide calls its exclusive Accelerator II technology, which helps speed the
        release of the active ingredient into the mound. This deep-reaching mound treatment starts killing fire ants within
        minutes of initial contact. Within 24 hours, it kills the colony, including the fire ant queen. This product limits
        new mound formation, but it doesn't promise long-lasting residual protection like some mound treatments do. </p>
        <h2 id="Application">Application: Easy to use, but needs to be watered-in</h2>
        <p>
        You'll need scissors to open the Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules bag, but it reseals easily.
        Just sprinkle 1/2 cup of the granules on each mound, including an area about 2 feet in each direction from the
        center. Always use a measuring cup that's devoted to pesticides only; never return it to your kitchen.</p>
        <p>
        Once you've applied the small, flaky gray-brown granules, they must be watered-in immediately. This releases the
        active ingredient and moves the insecticide solution down into the mound to make sure it contacts fire ants.
        Watering-in can be tricky with fire ant mounds, so take care not to disturb the mound. That can lead to fire ant
        bites and stings or cause the fire ants to relocate. (And when they relocate, it's usually a foot or two away, just
        out of the reach of the product you applied.)</p>
        <p>
        The Spectracide package instructions do a good job of stressing that you need to water-in the granules "GENTLY"
        &mdash; even using capital letters &mdash; and avoid using any kind of high-pressure spray. We've found that a
        garden watering can with a sprinkler head works well to water-in mounds.</p>
        <p>
        The Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules label also includes instructions for treating ants other
        than fire ants. It doesn't specify whether this product works on all ants or not, but it recommends spot treating
        individual ant hills with 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of the granules.</p>
        <p>
        For best results, apply this fire ant killer in morning or evening when fire ants are closer to the surface and
        foraging for food. This increases the number of ants likely to contact the active ingredient and spread it to other
        ants in the mound. Do not use these granules in vegetable gardens or around other edible crops. Stick to lawns and
        ornamental areas only.</p>
        <h2 id="Pets">Pets and Children: Reenter after treated area is watered-in and dries</h2>
        <p>
        As with any pesticide, you should clear the area of people and pets when you're applying Spectracide Fire Ant Shield
        Mound Destroyer Granules. Once you've watered the treated area and your lawn is dry, you and your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5777FB0C397044708AB187D571E49994&amp;_z=z">pets can reenter the area</a>. Never leave
        granular pesticides in a pile; always scatter or sprinkle them so piles don't attract curious pets and kids. </p>
        <h2 id="Competition">Competition: Spectracide&reg; Fire Ant Shield&trade; Mound Destroyer&trade; Granules vs. Over'n Out!&reg; Advanced Fire Ant Killer Mound
        Eliminator</h2>
        <p>
        Both Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules and its competition, Over'n Out! Advanced Fire Ant Killer
        Mound Eliminator, work to kill fire ants by contact, so only ants that contact the active ingredients in these
        products die. Both products are dry granular formulas that call for the same application rates, and they're easy to
        measure and sprinkle on mounds. Both must be watered-in immediately after application, and both have
        resealable bags.</p>
        <p>
        Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules start killing within minutes and kill the colony and queen
        within 24 hours. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B18FEB5F1EC4701A6742BC508A1D11C&amp;_z=z">Over'n Out! Advanced Fire Ant
        Killer Mound Eliminator</a> kills the mound in 15 minutes and kills the queen within 24 hours. Both fast-acting
        products come with guarantees, but the Over'n Out product provides six months of fire ant control. The Spectracide
        Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules product does not make that claim.</p>
        <p>
        The Spectracide product is one of the most economical fire ant mound treatments on the market at just $3.77 for a
        3.5-pound bag. The Over'n Out product goes for $10.54 for a 4-pound bag &mdash; more than double the price per pound
        &mdash; but the six-month killing action offsets the need for repeat treatments, which we appreciate.</p>

        <h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions: Fast-acting, economical mound treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Spectracide Fire Ant Shield Mound Destroyer Granules is an easy-to-use fire ant mound treatment that promises to act
        fast to kill the queen. Even though it doesn't offer long-lasting residual protection, it's hard to beat the
        product's low price. </p>
