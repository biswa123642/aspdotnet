        <p>Over'n Out! Advanced Fire Ant Killer won our top spot overall based on several points: It kills the mound in just 15 minutes, kills the queen within 24 hours and a single application protects against fire ants for up to six months. Those promises are tough to beat. These ready-to-use granules are also super easy to apply, can be used for mounds and broadcast treatments and we feel comfortable using them in areas where pets and kids will play.

        "When I first received the product, I currently didn't have any fire ants. I knew they would come though. Once they
        appeared, this product worked like a charm, at the first sign of a mound I applied the product as directed. In no time,
        they were gone! It was such a relief because not only do I react horribly, but we have a dog and multiple children
        running through our yard. I'm glad it only took a little of the product to do the trick so we will be ready if they
        return."
