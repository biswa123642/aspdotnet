        "I wasn't aware of this product prior to purchasing, but I'm very impressed with the results. I live in Texas and fire
        ants are a huge problem, so it's a battle I'm always fighting. This product is easy to use, odorless and has a closure
        that is convenient for storage. Other products I've used in the past were like a powder, but this is granules, so it's
        easier to apply. It penetrates the mounds well after applying water. The results were quick and the ants were gone
        within an hour. It's been seven days and the treated mounds have not relocated, so mission accomplished. I will be
        repurchasing this product and have already recommended it to several neighbors."
