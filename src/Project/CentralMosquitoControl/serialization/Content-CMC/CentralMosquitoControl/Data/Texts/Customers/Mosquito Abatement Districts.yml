        <h4>MOSQUITO ABATEMENT DISTRICTS</h4>
        <p>For Mosquito Abatement Districts, Central Life Sciences offers adulticides and larvicides in a variety of formulations to give professionals the opportunity for complete control of mosquito populations in every corner of their communities.</p>
        <p>Altosid&reg;, an Insect Growth Regulator, gets its power from (S)-Methoprene, a target-specific active with a low toxicity profile that will not affect fish, waterfowl, mammals or beneficial predatory insects.</p>
        <p>Our product line also includes synergized pyrethroids Pyronyl&trade; and Perm-X&trade;, as well as FOURSTAR&reg; microbial larvicides, for full-spectrum coverage.</p>
