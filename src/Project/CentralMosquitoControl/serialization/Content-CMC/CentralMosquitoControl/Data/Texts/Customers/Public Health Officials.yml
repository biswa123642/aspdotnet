        <h4>PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS</h4>
        <p>When the outbreak of vector-borne disease poses a health threat, public health officials can depend on Zenivex&reg;. This high-efficacy, reduced-risk adulticide provides quick, permanent knockdown and reliable control of adult mosquito populations. Zenivex is ready-to-use for hand, ground or aerial application, requires no aquatic setbacks and has crop approval so it can be sprayed throughout urban and rural settings. Pyronyl&trade; and Perm-X&trade;, our synergized pyrethroids, offer an economical alternative for many applications.</p>
        <p>Adding an Insect Growth Regulator such as Altosid&reg; IGR, or microbial larvicide FOURSTAR&reg;, to your mosquito control program will help achieve long-term control by preventing larvae from maturing into breeding, biting adults.</p>
