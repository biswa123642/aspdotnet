        <h1>A history of innovation and thought leadership</h1>
        <p>Since Central Life Sciences discovered the insect growth regulators (IGR) methoprene, hydroprene and kinoprene over 40 years ago, we have dedicated our efforts to improving public health and well-being, with trusted products to control economic, nuisance and disease-carrying insect pests&mdash;with mosquitoes being a primary target. </p>
        <p>MADs and PHOs across the country have come to depend on our diverse portfolio of mosquito management solutions&mdash;which includes patented formulations and delivery technologies along with our breadth of larvicides and adulticides.</p>
        <p>As the preeminent industry supporter of the American Mosquito Control Association (AMCA), we have sponsored AMCA webinars, national and regional association meetings and events, and have even funded travel for first-time attendees of AMCA Washington Days who could not otherwise afford to attend, including students.</p>
        <p>
        Our thought leadership and industry stewardship is evident far beyond our products and support. Well before concern over the spread of Zika virus invaded the world&rsquo;s consciousness, we provided mosquito control professionals with communications tools to support their efforts. This support has recently been expanded to include our new SLAP campaign, a mosquito awareness campaign coming soon to communities nationwide, as well as on the web at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.mosquito-awareness.com/" target="_blank">mosquito-awareness.com</a>.</p>
