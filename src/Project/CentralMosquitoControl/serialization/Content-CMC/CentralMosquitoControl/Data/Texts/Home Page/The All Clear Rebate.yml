        <h2>The ALL Clear Rebate</h2>
        <p>At Central Life Sciences, we have always sought to provide environmentally compatible control. In 1968, we discovered the compound (S)-methoprene, the original insect growth regulator. It was developed to halt mosquito growth in the larval stage. This was a different control method, borne from stopping mosquitoes in a more environmentally responsible way. Driven to satisfy our customers, we are constantly producing new innovations. The All Clear Rebate is part of the effort to provide environmentally conscious mosquito control that meets ever-changing needs.</p>
