        As a new puppy parent, you&rsquo;re likely in search of the best natural treats to provide your furry companion.
        You&rsquo;ve heard bully sticks are a popular option that dogs go wild for, but can puppies enjoy these
        delicious
        chews, too? The answer is yes; bully sticks are safe for puppies who are over five pounds and have all their
        adult
        teeth (which is typically by six months of age, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/teeth-teething-and-chewing-in-puppies#:~:text=At%20around%2012%20weeks%2C%20the,deciduous%20teeth%20have%20fallen%20out" target="_blank">Veterinary Centers of America Inc.</a>).<br />
        <br />
        So, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/bully-stick-basics-what-are-bully-sticks-made-from" target="_blank">what are bully sticks made from</a>? These natural chews are made from just one ingredient:
        beef
        pizzle. They are an excellent reward for growing pups and adult dogs alike because they are easily digestible,
        high
        in protein, and low in fat. In addition, bully sticks help clean teeth as dogs chew and are long lasting to keep
        furry friends busy.<br />
        <br />
        Discover how to choose, feed, and supervise your puppy while they enjoy bully sticks&mdash;ensuring a safe,
        happy
        chewing adventure!<br />
        <h3>Choosing Bully Sticks</h3>
        <p>
        <img alt="bully stick placed along puppy’s paws" class="img-responsive" src="-/media/2DE8F3CDE9B44D3EB20146A070B2611E.ashx" /><br />
        <br />
        Once you determine that bully sticks are safe for your puppy, the next step is to find a high-quality
        option.
        Look for premium bully sticks made from the finest-quality cattle and free of artificial colors, fillers,
        and
        flavors. Cadet<sup>&reg;</sup> Bully Sticks check all these boxes&mdash;and they&rsquo;re oven-roasted to
        bring
        out the natural savory flavor dogs love!<br />
        <br />
        Bully sticks can range in size, so you have options in selecting the best, most manageable size for your
        best
        friend. For example, our x-small bully sticks are a great choice for smaller dogs weighing less than 10
        pounds.

        <h3>Feeding Bully Sticks</h3>
        Initially, only let your pup chew the bully stick for about five- to ten-minute periods. As with any
        high-protein
        chew, it&rsquo;s important to see how they affect your puppy&rsquo;s developing digestive system. If your puppy
        handles the treat fine, continue to increase the amount of time they chew.<br />
        Also keep in mind that puppies can have bully sticks in moderation; they&rsquo;re intended to be given as a
        treat&mdash;not a replacement for dog food. Because bully sticks are an addition to your furry friend&rsquo;s
        diet,
        stay mindful about how many calories your puppy consumes and talk to your veterinarian about recommended caloric
        intake to avoid overfeeding your pup.
        <h3>Supervising Chewing</h3>
        <p><img alt="puppy on carpet chewing bully stick " class="img-responsive" src="-/media/5433AD367E884E1280FFC0ED23B3BE14.ashx" /></p>
        <p>Always supervise your four-legged friend while they are enjoying a bully stick to ensure they don&rsquo;t
        bite
        off pieces too large to swallow. Additionally, take your pup&rsquo;s chew away when there is only a short
        amount
        left; this will ensure they don&rsquo;t get excited and gulp the last small part. You can even find bully
        stick
        holders, which are devices designed to help prevent pups from accessing the last few inches of the bully
        stick.
        As always, be sure to supply your dog with plenty of fresh water as they chew.<br />
        <br />
        </p>
