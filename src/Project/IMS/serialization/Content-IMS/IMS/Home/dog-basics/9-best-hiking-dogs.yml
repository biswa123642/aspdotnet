Hiking is a physically and mentally demanding activity, and certain dog breeds thrive with that type of challenge. Whether you are going out for a day trip or plan on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/going-camping-with-your-dog" target="_blank">going camping with your dog</a>, here are nine of the best hiking dog breeds (big and small) that will make the perfect companion for your next hiking adventure. </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #595959;">Large Hiking Breeds</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">1.

Originating from the cold Swiss Mountains, Bernese Mountain Dogs prefer to be outdoors and can adapt to journeys in any weather.&nbsp; </span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></h3> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">2. Siberian Husky</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="siberian husky dog hiking" width="730" src="-/media/5B0AC8729A9044D39D1F259A3E478C95.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">Bred to run tirelessly for long distances in front of a sled, the Siberian Husky is all about action. These outgoing dogs are curious creatures who are fearless when it comes to new activities. Huskies are comfortable in snowy terrain and on rocky trails, and they have even been known to happily jump into a body of water to cool down their thick coat. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">3. Labrador Retriever</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="labrador retriever dog playing in lake" width="730" src="-/media/0DB6DF62EF934FFDBF64F9687AF6F263.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;You can expect a Labrador Retriever to stay sensible, even-tempered, and ready to walk for hours on the trail&mdash;making them excellent hiking partners! As their name suggests, retrievers live for a game of fetch. Plus, they are major water lovers! Therefore, choosing a hike that leads to a body of water is ideal for this Cadet. Some of our favorite <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/dog-friendly-hiking-trails" target="_blank">dog-friendly hiking trails</a> are great spots to discover a variety of terrains.&nbsp; </span></p> <h2><span style="color: #595959;">Medium Hiking Breeds</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">4. Australian Shepherd </span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="australian shepherd dog hiking on trail" width="730" src="-/media/E23807CA07B948109F6AD91B1734828F.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">The Australian Shepherd is the winning combination of intelligence, ability, and personality. They make excellent hiking dogs, as they excel in agility and obedience during long hours of demanding activity.&nbsp; Australian Shepherds are friendly and make for happy wanderers when you encounter other hikers and their four-legged friends. </span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">5. Border Collie</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="border collie dog hiking on trail " width="730" src="-/media/9D7E05CD42394FF9924079B37156187E.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">Trail running is a fast-growing sport for people who enjoy exercising in nature. With a high level of speed and intelligence, the Border Collie is a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/best-dogs-for-runners" target="_blank">great dog for runners</a>. Border Collies also require mental stimulation, so hiking (or running) on moderate trails with diverse terrain can be an excellent outlet for them to burn off some energy.</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">6. German Shorthaired Pointer</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt=" german shorthaired pointer dog outside " width="730" src="-/media/F9A9A337DC684A5893E16923832C050C.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">The German Shorthaired Pointer is full of enthusiasm and energy! These active companions love exercise and need as much of it as they can get. This makes them the best hiking dogs for longer outings where they can spend hours running around vast fields or even diving into ponds. The German Shorthaired Pointer&rsquo;s personality and excitement for the outdoors is contagious, which makes them a great trail buddy.</span></p> <h2><span style="color: #595959;">Small Hiking Breeds</span></h2> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">7. Beagle</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="beagle dog outside hiking " width="730" src="-/media/165A440F15A345FA8814DDFBCF81A6E1.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">Never judge a dog&rsquo;s athletic ability by its size. Beagles are great hikers because of their confidence and prized ability to find and stay on the trail. They have a strong sense of smell, so you may even notice your furry hiking partner picking up some unique scents during your adventure. Beagles are known for their big appetites, so be sure to give them lots of water and a tasty, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/premium-treats" target="_blank">healthy dog treat</a> as a reward after the hike. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">8. Cairn Terrier</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="cairn terrier dog running outside " width="730" src="-/media/468EBD66BEAD484190AFFC9984278AA8.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">The Cairn Terrier might be a less obvious choice when you think of the best hiking dogs. However, they <em>love</em> to investigate the world. Their wiry outercoat and downy undercoat were intended to protect them from the harsh and unpredictable weather and environment of northern Scotland, where Cairn Terriers originate. They are also known to be active into their teens, which makes this Cadet a great hiking buddy to have by your side for years. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3><span style="color: #595959;">9. Jack Russell Terrier</span></h3> <p><span style="color: #595959;"><img height="362" alt="jack russell terrier dog hiking " width="730" src="-/media/6E6F1FF6E79641459FC6E62EC43E0FDC.ashx" /></span></p> <p><span style="color: #595959;">The Jack Russell Terrier may come in a small frame, but this dog is both energetic and enduring.
