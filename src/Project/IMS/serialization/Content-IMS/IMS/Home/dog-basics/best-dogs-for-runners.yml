        <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="Woman running with dog" src="-/media/BC6C3D46172D48BC9B71D63230C4672C.ashx" /></p>
        <p>The only thing more dependable than a daily running route is a furry friend who will join you! If you prefer to run for miles at a time, these breeds make great sidekicks.</p>
        <h3>Labrador Retrievers</h3>
        <p>Not only are Labrador Retrievers among the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/top-10-dog-breeds-in-america" target="_blank">most popular dog breeds in America</a>, they also excel at covering long distances. While Labs are not particularly fast, they have excellent stamina and will be happy to join you on runs of virtually any length. Their kind temperament also makes them a highly trainable breed, which always comes in handy when teaching your dog to walk or run on a leash.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>German Shorthaired Pointers</h3>
        <p>Few breeds can tack on miles as quickly as German Shorthaired Pointers. While these dogs are great at sprinting, they really thrive when they run long distances. They were originally bred for hunting, giving them plenty of endurance for extra-long routes. German Shorthaired Pointers are so efficient at running, they can make an extensive jog look easy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Vizslas</h3>
        <p>Gentle Vizslas might not come to mind when you think of the best running dogs, but they require vigorous outdoor exercise. In fact, these dogs need at least one hour of exercise every day, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/vizsla#/slide/1" target="_blank">Dogtime</a>. Vizslas have a long, quick gait that lets them run fast for extended periods. If you like to navigate your route at a faster-than-average pace, a Vizsla can go the distance with you!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Belgian Malinois</h3>
        <p>Born with a love for completing tasks and spending time with their human family members, Belgian Malinois are a natural fit for any distance runner. These strong dogs are known for their sheepherding abilities, and their fantastic work ethic is just as important to running. Belgian Malinois are tough to wear out, so a long run might be just what your furry friend needs to get their fix.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><a name="Trail Running"></a></p>
        <h2>Best Dogs for Trail Running</h2>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="Person running with dog on grass" width="730" src="-/media/12674F1F343F4ED8809EF5425B1C7101.ashx" /></p>
        <p>For trailblazers, factors such as terrain and endurance are important considerations when choosing the best running dogs. The following breeds are well equipped to handle nature&rsquo;s challenges.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Border Collies</h3>
        <p>Border Collies are among the fastest breeds on our list, and they are also some of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/10-intelligent-dog-breeds" target="_blank">most intelligent dogs</a>. These traits, combined with great energy and trainability, make them exceptional companions for off-leash trail running. Just be sure your Border Collie knows the &ldquo;drop it&rdquo; command in case they get their mouth on plants, sticks, or other objects in nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Australian Shepherds</h3>
        <p>Does your favorite trail have lots of obstacles along the path? Australian Shepherds will gladly accept the challenge! Like many of the good running dogs on this list, Australian Shepherds have a rich working history and need demanding physical activity to scratch their exercise itch. These dogs are spry and agile enough to master some of the most difficult routes, and their energetic personality will keep them happy along the way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Jack Russell Terriers</h3>
        <p>That&rsquo;s right; Jack Russell Terriers may be small, but they are very capable of joining you on an up-tempo hike! These active dogs for runners can manage quick routes or extensive trails, making them adaptable to a variety of exercise routines. Given their compact size, Jack Russells are also great for runners who live in apartments or condos.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Dalmatians</h3>
        <p>A very trainable breed, Dalmatians can be taught to run on off-leash trails. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/hiking-with-dogs" target="_blank">Hiking with these dogs is</a> a breeze over long distances due to their high stamina, so you won&rsquo;t be restricted to the shortest loops available on the trail. Dalmatians prefer running at consistent speeds, so try to keep a steady pace together.</p>

        <p><a name="Sprinting"></a></p>
        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>Best Dogs for Sprinting</h2>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="German Shepherd running" width="730" src="-/media/54BD6C6F5E7540E39FFF74909C78A83A.ashx" /></p>
        <p>Not every runner is built for distance. Likewise, some dog breeds do best in shorter, all-out bursts of energy. These furry friends can keep up with even the fastest sprinters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Greyhounds</h3>
        <p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Greyhounds make the list of best running dogs for sprinters. After all, they&rsquo;re the fastest dog breed in the world and can reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour, according to <em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rd.com/article/fastest-dog-breed/" target="_blank">Reader&rsquo;s Digest</a></em>. While you won&rsquo;t be running that fast together, Greyhounds shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble matching your pace. These dogs are not ideal partners for distance runs, though, so it&rsquo;s wise to keep runs short.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Pit Bulls</h3>
        <p>Another speedy breed, Pit Bulls are good running dogs for covering ground quickly. While they do not have lasting tenacity and should not run more than a few miles at a time, Pit Bulls have strong muscles that are ideal for sprinting. Their close-to-the-ground body type also contributes to their high-speed profile.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>German Shepherds</h3>
        <p>From police work to search &amp; rescue assistance, German Shepherds take on a variety of important, physically demanding jobs. They are tremendous sprinters and highly trainable, making them the perfect package for any fast runner. Make sure you keep your German Shepherd physically and mentally stimulated throughout the day to keep up with their needs!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Weimaraner</h3>
        <p>Active pet parents are a smart match for Weimaraners. These lively pooches need copious amounts of exercise, so a daily sprint can help check this box. Their long, muscular legs fit the bill for fast and long-distance running, opening up many routes for you and your Weimaraner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Ready to Run?</h2>
        <p>Whether you prefer slow, long runs or more brisk routes, there are many great dogs for runners to match your style. Once you <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/running-with-dogs" target="_blank">teach your dog how to run</a> with you, you&rsquo;ll be ready to explore the park, neighborhood, or trail together. Enjoy the exercise!&nbsp;</p>
