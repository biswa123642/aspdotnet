        <p>As you already know, dogs like food&mdash;a lot. Using food treats as part of your daily interaction with your dog can make life a lot more fun. Treats make a great reward, training tool, and bonding instrument. Used wisely, treats provide a lift in the spirit and help make each day special. And luckily for dogs, we humans get a kick out of treating them to that special little something above and beyond meals. Just remember that while indulging your dog is great fun for both of you, those special little treats and snacks should be just that&mdash;they should not be fed in place of a meal.</p>
        <p>But which type of dog snack should you try? Read on for eight tempting treats guaranteed to tickle every canine palate!</p>
        <h3>#1: BULLY STICKS AND PIGGY STICKS</h3>
        <p>These <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/4-natural-dog-treats-and-their-benefits" target="_blank">natural dog treats</a> are grain-free, gluten-free, and preservative-free. They do not have artificial colors or fillers and contain only natural flavors. Made with just a single ingredient, these premium dog treats double as chews and can keep a dog busy and happy for hours.</p>
        <h3>#2: REAL BEEF STRIPS, BONES, AND TENDONS</h3>
        <p>These natural, single-ingredient treats are delicious and wholesome. Cadet<sup>&reg;</sup> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/natural-chews/cadet-natural-treats-100-beef-strips" target="_blank">Beef Strips</a> are made from 100% natural beef esophagus, which is a high-protein, low-fat treat with no artificial ingredients. Beef bones are flavored shin bones that come in a variety of sizes for all dogs. Lastly, beef tendons are a wonderful alternative to bully sticks and rawhide&mdash;they are high in protein, low in fat, highly digestible, and extremely tasty to dogs. As a bonus, they&rsquo;re beneficial for your dog&rsquo;s teeth, too!</p>
        <h3>#3: RAWHIDE BONES</h3>
        <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/rawhide-basics-what-is-rawhide" target="_blank">Rawhide bones are long-lasting chews for dogs</a> and have a terrific dental benefit: They help reduce plaque and tartar buildup. Your dog is bound to love this classic.</p>
        <h3>#4: DENTAL CHEWS FOR DOGS</h3>
        <p>Dogs can become victims of periodontal problems the same way humans can, suffering bad breath, pain, swollen gums, and the like. Dental chews, whether natural or created of synthetic material, are powerful weapons to help maintain your pet&rsquo;s oral health.</p>
        <p>And who says dog treats have to be edible? Non-edible dog chew toys serve the same purpose and are preferred by some dogs. Keep in mind that dental chews should not be a substitute for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth" target="_blank">brushing your dog&rsquo;s teeth</a> thoroughly; it&rsquo;s also important for him to get a professional cleaning when needed.</p>
        <h3>#5: DOG JERKY TREATS</h3>
        <p>These savory, high protein dog treats are a delicious everyday snack your dog will love. The entire line of Cadet<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/premium-treats" target="_blank">dog jerky treats</a>, is inspected in the USA and contains no artificial colors, fillers, or flavors&mdash;just rich, delicious flavors like duck, chicken, and <a href="http://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/are-sweet-potatoes-good-for-dogs">sweet potato</a>.</p>
        <h3>#6: CRUNCHY DOG TREATS</h3>
        <p>Many dogs prefer a solid crunch as they snack. Cadet<sup>&reg;</sup> products offer a variety of premium-quality beef-, chicken-, and peanut butter-basted crunchy dog chews.</p>
        <h3>#7: HOMEMADE DOG TREATS</h3>
        <p>Many people prefer the homemade touch and go to the trouble of cooking up special delights for their dogs.</p>
        <p>Delicious, mouthwatering <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nylabone.com/dog101/frozen-dog-treat-recipes" target="_blank">homemade dog treats</a> can feature beef bouillon, eggs, banana, peanut butter, wheat germ, powdered milk, and the like. As with any recipe, your choices are limited only by your imagination, as long as your imagination doesn&rsquo;t wander too much into a sugary, high-fat zone. Of course, avoid making anything with ingredients proved to be toxic to dogs, including grapes and raisins, onion and garlic, chocolate, caffeine, macadamia nuts, and the artificial sweetener xylitol.</p>
        <p>Simple treats such as baby carrots, seedless apple slices, rice cakes, air-popped popcorn, and bits of hardboiled eggs are delightful, tasty, and inexpensive. Dogs with a sweet tooth can be charmed with watermelon and berries.</p>
        <h3>#8: THE BEST TREAT OF ALL</h3>
        <p>There is one treat, however, that surpasses all the others. It has no harmful chemicals. It is non-fattening. It is grain-free and gluten-free. In fact, it&rsquo;s free, period. And it is, of course, your dog&rsquo;s favorite: your kind attention and praise. Your dog loves you, and returning that love is the best gift you can give him!</p>
