        A microchip is one of the biggest safety nets you can have when it comes to your dog&rsquo;s wellbeing. In fact, pets with microchips are up to 20 times more likely to be reunited with their owners, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.akcreunite.org/reunitehelpsstolendogs/" target="_blank">AKC Reunite</a>. Although many pet parents understand just how important these devices can be, few of us stop to ask, &ldquo;how do dog microchips actually work?&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve answered six essential questions about how microchips are implanted, what information they contain, how they help lost dogs return safe and sound, and more.&nbsp;<br />
        <h2>#1: What Is a Dog Microchip?&nbsp;</h2>
        From staying safe on a walk to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/pet-disaster-preparedness-tips" target="_blank">preparing for a natural disaster with your dog</a>, microchips can protect your pup in a variety of situations. So, what is a dog microchip? This rice-sized electronic device is a radio-frequency identification transponder, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/how-do-dog-microchips-work/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a>. In other words, each microchip has a &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; that veterinarians and animal shelter employees can scan to retrieve the dog&rsquo;s unique identification number. This one-of-a-kind number can then be searched on a pet recovery database, where the pet parent&rsquo;s contact information is located. As long as you are registered with one of these databases, your dog&rsquo;s finder will have a way to reach you.&nbsp;<br />
        <h2>#2: How Is a Microchip Inserted?</h2>
        <img height="362" alt="dog-at-veterinarian-office" width="730" src="-/media/B77E3AC5A4ED4400ACF09F070FDC1523.ashx" /><br />
        <br />
        Most dogs do not need anesthesia to receive their microchip; if your pup has previously received an injection without too much fuss, getting their chip inserted should be simple! A veterinarian typically implants the microchip under a dog&rsquo;s loose skin beneath the shoulder blades, and the chip is often embedded in surgical glass to prevent infection. Some microchips are also designed to bond with the tissue under a dog&rsquo;s skin and stay in place, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.petfinder.com/dogs/lost-and-found-dogs/how-pet-microchips-work/" target="_blank">Petfinder</a>.&nbsp;<br />
        <h2>#3: Can a Microchip Track a Dog&rsquo;s Location?&nbsp;</h2>
        Put simply, no. While there are GPS trackers capable of following your dog&rsquo;s every move, microchips provide access to your information in the pet recovery database&mdash;not location-specific details. If you are interested in a GPS tracker, understand it must be charged periodically and you may need to pay a monthly service fee.&nbsp;<br />
        <h2>#4: Do All Microchips Work the Same Way?</h2>
        <img height="362" alt="dog-microchip" width="730" src="-/media/0F035EEEB2E847DF845FE6DE17931757.ashx" /><br />
        Although not all brands produce microchips with the same radio frequency, a universal ISO (International Organization for Standardization) compliant scanner can read just about any chip. There are no clear advantages of using one frequency over another, however a veterinarian or shelter employee may run into trouble if they do not have a universal scanner capable of reading a particular frequency. Depending on the database with which your microchip is registered, your furry friend&rsquo;s identification information may be sent to local vets and shelters if your dog is reported as lost.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <h2>#5: How Long Do Microchips Last?&nbsp;</h2>
        Microchips are designed to work for 25 years, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/high-tech-identifying-lost-pets-microchips" target="_blank">Humane Society of the United States</a>. They do not require batteries, making them a great fallback option if your dog goes missing without any other form of identification. Just ask your vet to check your dog&rsquo;s microchip during routine visits and verify that it can still be scanned.&nbsp;<br />
        <h2>#6: Do Microchipped Dogs Still Need ID Tags?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p> <img height="362" alt="labrador-retriever-wearing-id-tag" width="730" src="-/media/1A1D041160FA455FA98401D19C79F00F.ashx" /></p>
        <p>Yes! A microchip can help keep your dog safe, but it&rsquo;s not completely foolproof if your dog gets loose. After all, a stranger who finds your missing pup probably won&rsquo;t have a microchip scanner and may not even know your dog is chipped. Make sure your dog is always wearing an ID tag with their name plus your up-to-date address and phone number. Not to mention, teaching <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/dog-obedience-training-for-beginners" target="_blank">dog obedience training</a> commands such as sit and stay is another great way to help your Cadet stay close to you.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Safety First!&nbsp;</h2>
        Although the question, &ldquo;How do dog microchips work?&rdquo; may have entered your mind today, you should frequently ask yourself, &ldquo;What can I do to keep my dog safe?&rdquo; Whether you&rsquo;re leaving your dog home while at work or visiting a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/dog-friendly-hiking-trails" target="_blank">dog-friendly hiking trail</a> together, take a moment to make sure your Cadet is out of harm&rsquo;s way. That includes doublechecking the front door is completely closed, ensuring your dog&rsquo;s leash is secure, and taking any other necessary measures to reduce the chance of your pup escaping. You can never be too cautious!&nbsp;<br />
