        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to Prepare Before a Disaster</strong></span></h2>
        <h3><strong>Create a Pet Emergency Kit</strong></h3>
        A comprehensive and easily accessible emergency kit will help you and your dog ride out a disaster. Your dog&rsquo;s kit should include:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Food and water</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">First aid kit</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Spare ID tag</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Leash</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/premium-treats">Treats</a> and toys</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Medicines</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Important documents like adoption papers and vaccination records</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Dog waste bags</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Contact info for your veterinarian, local animal shelter, friends, and relatives</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Flashlight</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Blanket</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Water bowl</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: #000000;">Crate or carrier</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">You should bring enough food and water to last your dog at least three days, according to <a href="https://www.ready.gov/animals">Ready.gov</a>. Additionally, your first aid kit should include items like bandages, cotton balls, gauze pads, scissors, tweezers, tape, and hydrogen peroxide. If you have time to prepare before an evacuation, consider bringing any other items that comfort your dog, such as their favorite toy or occupying <a href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/natural-chews">natural dog chews</a>.<br />
        </span></p>
        <h3>Get a Pet Rescue Sticker</h3>
        This sticker lets first responders know how many pets are in your home. Your pet rescue sticker should be placed on or near your front door and include the number of pets in your home, a brief physical description, and your vet&rsquo;s name and number, according to <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/disaster-preparedness">ASPCA</a>. If you evacuate with your pets in the event of a disaster threat, write &ldquo;EVACUATED&rdquo; on the sticker to keep first responders informed. Be sure to write legibly and update the information as needed. You can sign up for a <a href="https://secure.aspca.org/take-action/order-your-pet-safety-pack">free pet rescue sticker</a> from ASPCA or purchase one from your local pet store. <br />
        <h3>Tag and Chip Your Pet</h3>
        Your pet should wear an ID tag at all times with essential information like your address, phone number, and your pet&rsquo;s name. <a href="https://www.ready.gov/animals">Ready.gov</a> recommends including an emergency contact outside of your immediate area as well. Make sure these details are up-to-date. If your dog doesn&rsquo;t already have a microchip, strongly consider getting one from your vet. Because microchips are registered in a national database, this device is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect your dog. <br />
        <h3>Locate Shelters and Vets</h3>
        Many emergency shelters do not accept pets. <a href="https://www.ready.gov/animals">Ready.gov</a> suggests identifying nearby pet-friendly shelters, hotels, boarding facilities, and animal hospitals. You should also identify vets both within and outside of your immediate area. Get in touch with your local emergency management office for specific recommendations in the event of a disaster. <br />
        <h3>Stay in the Know</h3>
        Tune in to your local news station and listen for details about potential natural disasters. If your area is prone to regional threats like hurricanes or tornados, conduct some research and find out if you&rsquo;ll need to take specific precautions. <a href="https://www.ready.gov/animals">Ready.gov</a> suggests downloading the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app">FEMA app</a> to receive weather alerts for your location.

        </span></p>
        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What to Do During a Disaster</strong></span></h2>
        <h3>Take Action</h3>
        Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to put your pet emergency kit together. If you have advanced notice of a natural disaster, organize your supplies and keep them close. Your flashlight should be ready to go with fresh batteries, especially if you&rsquo;re expecting power outages. Carry a charged phone and a charger and know who to contact in the event of an emergency. If authorities urge you to evacuate, head to a shelter or other place of refuge as early as possible. Leaving pets at home can put them at risk, so bring your dog with you if possible. <br />
        <h3>Stay Calm</h3>
        Try to keep your furry family member at peace. Use positive body language to communicate safety and comfort rather than fear. Loud noises are often associated with disasters and can make your dog anxious, so be sure to give them plenty of affection and praise as you weather the event together. <br />
        <h3>Find a Safe Place</h3>
        If you must endure the disaster at home, bring your family and dog to your home&rsquo;s safest room at the first sight of trouble. This location could vary depending on the event. For example, the highest room in your house may be the safest during a flood, while the basement or cellar is probably your best bet during a tornado. ASPCA recommends choosing a room that&rsquo;s clear of possible hazards like windows and flying debris, as well as filling bathtubs and sinks with water in the event of a power outage. Keep a radio, smartphone, or any other device that can provide updates on the disaster, and don&rsquo;t leave home until it&rsquo;s safe.
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em><br />
        </em>After the Disaster</strong></span></h2>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">If your dog sustains any injuries, take them to the vet once you&rsquo;re cleared to leave. Also keep in mind that it may be days or even weeks before you can return to your home, so you may have to board your dog. Look for pet boarding facilities near you if you expect to be away from home for an extended period. <a href="https://www.ready.gov/animals">Ready.gov</a> claims most boarding kennels, veterinarians, and animal shelters will need you pet&rsquo;s medical records to make sure their vaccinations are current, so don&rsquo;t leave home without this critical information.</span></p>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Many disasters come without warning, so practicing pet disaster preparedness is a great way to start bracing for a potentially dangerous situation. If you and your dog start planning now, you will be much better equipped to handle a range of natural disasters and other emergencies.</span><br />
