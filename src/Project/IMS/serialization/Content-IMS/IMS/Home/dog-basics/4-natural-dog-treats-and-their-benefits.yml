We even pair this satisfying root vegetable with other fan-favorite flavors in several of our premium treats!&nbsp;<br /> <h2>#3: Pig Ears&nbsp;</h2> <img height="362" alt="dog eating pig ear" width="730" src="-/media/FFAD257582524D7CA0799E7866B68B4D.ashx" class="img-responsive" /><br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our protein-packed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/natural-chews/cadet-pig-ears" target="_blank">Pig Ears</a> are oven-roasted to bring out the naturally delicious, meaty flavor dogs can&rsquo;t resist. Made of 100% real pork, these long-lasting dog treats are specially crafted to satisfy your furry friend and keep them busy. As your dog chews, our pig ears also promote oral health by helping to clean teeth and gums&mdash;just like many of our other products!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Chew treats that are good for your pet&rsquo;s dental health come with numerous advantages, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.herschelanimalclinic.com/blog/benefits-of-pet-dental-treats.html" target="_blank">Herschel Animal Clinic</a>. Some of these advantages include loosening food debris and stimulating the production of saliva to neutralize and fight plaque acids that cause tooth decay. In addition, the action of chewing helps fight boredom and provides mental stimulation for your pup.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> &nbsp; <h2>#4: Beef Esophagus</h2> Natural dog treats made of 100% real beef esophagus, such as our long-lasting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/natural-chews/cadet-natural-treats-100-beef-strips" target="_blank">Beef Strips</a>, are a highly digestible and nutritious option for rewarding your best friend. As with other natural beef chews, esophagus is a low-fat, high-protein option that dogs love and pet parents can feel good giving.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Plus, beef esophagus contains naturally occurring chondroitin sulfate. This substance is found in animal cartilage and helps support hip and joint health.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2>Bonus: Beef Hide Chews&nbsp;</h2> <p> While not considered a treat due to their extra long-lasting nature, our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/all-products/rawhide" target="_blank">Beef Hide chews</a> still have terrific health benefits! Made of 100% real beef hide and sourced from premium-quality cattle, these safe, single-ingredient chews contain naturally occurring collagen for dogs. A protein integral to the body&rsquo;s structure, collagen can be thought of as the glue that holds the body together.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> As your pup ages, their collagen production slows. Dog chews containing collagen may help to reduce age-related problems by providing strength and elasticity to your dog&rsquo;s skin and ligaments, along with much of the rest of their body, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/skin/c_multi_cutaneous_asthenia" target="_blank">PetMD</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cadetpet.com/dog-basics/rawhide-basics-what-is-rawhide" target="_blank">&rarr; RELATED: What is Rawhide?
