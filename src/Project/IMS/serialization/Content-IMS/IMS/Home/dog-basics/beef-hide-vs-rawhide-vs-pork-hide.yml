As you consider which items to pick up for your furry friend, you may find yourself asking &ldquo;Is beef hide the same as rawhide?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wait, pork hide exists, too?&rdquo; While their names sound quite similar and they often look alike, all three flavorful options do vary from one another.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the differences between these natural dog chews to simplify your next shopping experience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>What is Beef Hide?</h2> <p>Beef hide is a premium type of rawhide made specifically from the inner layer of cattle skin.

These natural, long-lasting chews offer satisfyingly delicious entertainment and keep dogs busy.</p> <p>So...is beef hide the same as rawhide? Sort of!
