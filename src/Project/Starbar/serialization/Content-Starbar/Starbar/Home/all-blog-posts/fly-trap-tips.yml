        <p>Fly control is an important step for success on your operation. Using fly traps along with an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program will help provide effective control against flies, creating a productive and healthy environment for you, your livestock and your employees. To boost fly control efforts, here are a few tips that&rsquo;ll help you set successful traps around your property:</p> <h2>Tip 1: Apply traps at every level </h2> <p>From the floor to the ceiling, flies can gather just about anywhere. That&rsquo;s why Starbar&reg; products are designed to provide fly control at every level around your property. </p> <ul>     <li>Low Levels: Flies tend to feed at the low levels of a farm or operation. Place your traps on the ground to attract flies while they feed. </li>     <li>Medium Levels: You can hang traps such as our  <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/fly-terminator-pro-fly-trap">Fly Terminator&reg; Pro Fly Trap</a>, along fences and walls to target flies where they typically mate. </li>     <li>High Levels: For high level fly control and targeting flies while they rest, hang traps around the ceiling. </li> </ul> <p>Using a combination of these methods will provide your property with an all-encompassing method for controlling flies. </p> <h2>Tip 2:  Hit flies with a one-two punch</h2> <p>Unique areas around your property require unique solutions. That&rsquo;s why Starbar&reg; provides two types of traps for your fly control needs. </p> <ul>     <li>Chemical Attractants: To attract flies looking to mate, use Starbar&rsquo;s dry fly attractant pouch as a great companion to use in Starbar&reg; traps that use water. Products like <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/flyrelief-disposable-fly-traps">FlyRelief&trade; Disposable Fly Traps</a> and <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/trap-n-toss-disposable-fly-trap">Trap &lsquo;N Toss&trade; Disposable Fly Trap</a> come with their own attractant and can be thrown out or emptied and reused when filled up with flies. For products such as the <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/captivator-fly-trap">Captivator&reg; Fly Trap</a>, place the water soluble pouch of fly trap attractant into the water of the trap. </li>     <li>Bright Colors to Attract Flies: For higher levels on an operation, traps with bright colors attract flies to land while looking for a place to rest. Starbar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/bite-free-stable-fly-trap">Bite Free&trade; Stable Fly Trap</a> shimmers with the sunlight and draws in stable flies and should be placed near ground level. The <a href="https://www.starbarproducts.com/all-products/traps/ez-trap-fly-trap">EZ Trap&reg; Fly Trap</a> is bright and compact while still providing a large surface area for effective control in harder to reach places.</li> </ul> <h2> Tip 3: Improve your IPM Program with Fly Traps</h2> <p>Utilizing fly traps in and around your property will help you measure the number of flies present and the extent of your property&rsquo;s fly problem. By doing so, you can identify which areas to target. Use traps together with fly baits to maximize control efforts and optimize your IPM program. </p> <p>Learn more about which fly traps are right for your operation with our <a href="-/media/9949B0B09A57423EB53205F895E6B896.ashx">Traps brochure</a>!</p>
