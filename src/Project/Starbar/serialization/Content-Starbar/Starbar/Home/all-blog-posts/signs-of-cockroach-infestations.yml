        <p>There are a few different indicators when it comes to telling if you have a cockroach infestation. Some of the signs of cockroach infestations may include roach droppings, roaches spotted foraging, egg casing and cast skins from cockroach molting, and finding cockroach body parts. It&rsquo;s best to react quickly if you notice any of these signs in or around your barn or facility. </p> <p>Roach droppings are one of the most common forms of roach evidence making them easy to spot. If you see small, dark fecal spots on surfaces, this may indicate the areas of roach activity or entrances to hidden shelters. Because roaches tend to congregate, the droppings may be more concentrated in some areas than others. Some places to check for roach infestations are in animal facilities, in and around barns, food storage locations, warm and dark environments, holes in the walls, and around appliances.</p> <p>As a roach population is expanding in one location, many are forced out of their shelters. Roaches usually only come out into the light to get food or due to overpopulation. Therefore, it is safe to assume there is a large population of roaches if they are spotted during the day. From contaminating food and damaging the infrastructure of your barn or facility, cockroach control should be the focal point of every facility regardless of the size.</p> <p>Cockroach egg casings, also known as oothecae, are another indicator of an infestation. These casings typically have a leathery appearance and are shaped like a bean, but the exact size and shape will vary on the cockroach species. Each egg can produce up to 40 nymphs, and with the shortest lifecycle, roaches will grow from their egg to full sexual maturity, quickly starting an infestation if not handled immediately. </p> <p>Finding cockroach body parts may also mean there are more hiding out of sight. If you find body parts such as legs or antennas, it is best to mark the location as a potential application site when applying roach control products.</p> <p>Starbar is here to help you find the right products for your operation by setting the bar for roach control. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EBBE3D8521104B03B280467DAD5C019F&amp;_z=z">Cyanarox<sup>&reg;</sup> Insecticidal Bait</a>&nbsp;is a ready-to-use granular bait ideal for indoor and outdoor applications.
