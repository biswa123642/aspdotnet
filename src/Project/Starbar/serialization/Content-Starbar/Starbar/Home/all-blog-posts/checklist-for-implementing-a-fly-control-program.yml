        <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that flies on a dairy are more than just a nuisance. Flies contribute to a loss in production, spread diseases and annoy both animals and employees. Protecting against fly infestations on a dairy can be an overwhelming task to someone starting a fly control program for the first time as well as for those looking to upgrade their current program. To protect dairy operations from costly fly infestations, it is important to use a variety of fly traps, fly baits, and on-animal treatments to manage disease-spreading fly populations. </p>
        <h2>STICKY TRAPS</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>After feeding, flies have a tendency to rest up high in the cooler regions of barns, stables and other buildings. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3EA0AABF23F343E6B519222E38A743B4&amp;_z=z">EZ<sup>&reg;</sup> Trap Fly Trap</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BB3EAFC72C1B4A939BC834E40B4D6DCD&amp;_z=z">Fly Stik<sup>&trade;</sup> Stick Fly Trap</a>&nbsp;from <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=91F68CDC85A744C5848383704C1A8822&amp;_z=z">Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> Products</a>&nbsp;are designed to trap flies in the areas where most other control methods fail to reach. These sticky traps have bright colors that entice flies to land, and they function without any chemicals or odor. These traps can also be used to monitor the amount of fly activity in barns. </p>
        <h2>ODOR AND PHEROMONE TRAPS</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In addition to sticky traps, Starbar also offers pheromone and odor traps, like the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FADDB1624DB2440A90F4630F334F73FB&amp;_z=z">Captivator<sup>&reg;</sup> Fly Trap</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=871C9866005C4121B36A09BD7A534C87&amp;_z=z">FlyRelief<sup>&trade;</sup> Disposable Fly Trap</a>. Since flies mate higher than feeding level but lower than resting level, these traps contain pheromones and feeding stimulants to lure flies looking to mate in between feeding and resting. Fence lines, short walls and shelves in barns, stables, and out buildings are ideal areas for placing odor and pheromone traps. </p>
        <h2>SCATTER BAITS, STRIPS AND TRAPS</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Flies feed at a low level. That&rsquo;s why our scatter baits and strips use a sugar base in combination with various attractants to encourage flies to feed. When using any fly bait, implementing a proper rotation plan is essential in fighting against resistance. When granular baits, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=42BF4C34B9B843CCBF1ED0DC6FD97503&amp;_z=z">Golden<sup>&reg;</sup> Malrin Fly Bait</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=878C200555F645698FB5FCBB630C1025&amp;_z=z">QuikStrike<sup>&reg;</sup> Fly Bait</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EBBE3D8521104B03B280467DAD5C019F&amp;_z=z">Cyanarox<sup>&reg;</sup> Insecticidal Bait</a>, are rotated throughout the fly season, their efficacy is increased and fly populations will decline. </p>
        <h2>ANIMAL AND PERIMETER TREATMENTS</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When a fly infestation hits a dairy, populations will quickly spread throughout the property. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to build a fly-control plan around a feed-through fly control product like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/" target="_blank">ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide</a>. Unlike conventional insecticides that attack the nervous system of insects, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/" target="_blank">ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide</a> works by interrupting the fly&rsquo;s life cycle, rather than through direct toxicity. When mixed into cattle feed, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralflycontrol.com/" target="_blank">ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide</a> passes through the digestive system and into the manure. To extend control to the whole herd, use a feed-through product for your calves as well, which will help reduce fly populations around calf hutches. Using <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6FD2EF9760BC402ABD01C3719E575C31&amp;_z=z">ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Add-Pack</a>&nbsp;in whole milk or milk replacer helps increase calf comfort and decrease the spread of disease. Using a combination of fly traps, fly baits, and feed-through products gives dairy producers a complete fly control program that will keep fly populations below the economic threshold. It is also crucial to implement a comprehensive integrated pest management (IPM) program that includes biological, physical-mechanical and cultural efforts to reinforce your fly control. By utilizing various types of fly control products found in the Starbar line, dairy producers are able to take their fly control efforts to the next level.</p>
