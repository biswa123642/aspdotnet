        <h2><strong>MAXIMIZE YOUR FLY CONTROL EFFORTS</strong></h2>
        <p>Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> products offer a complete line of fly bait solutions, including fly bait granules that can be scattered or used in a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=64F6D6D4572243F3958A8C51E9D98943&amp;_z=z">fly bait station</a>. By using Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> baits and fly strips near the ground, you&rsquo;ll set the bar for insect control to take advantage of fly foraging behavior.</p>
        <p>Flies feed at lower heights near the floor; that&rsquo;s why our scatter baits and strips use a sugar base in combination with various attractants to encourage flies to feed. These fly control products are ideal for large-scale as well as smaller operations. Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> fly baits are scientifically designed to help protect the low level of agriculture facilities and can be used in a rotation and part of an integrated pest management (IPM) program to discourage fly resistance. Rotation of fly baits is essential to avoid resistance, so rotating between different modes of action, ingredients and attractants is key.</p>
