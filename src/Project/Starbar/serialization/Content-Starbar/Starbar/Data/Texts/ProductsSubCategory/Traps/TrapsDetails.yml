        <h2><strong>MAXIMIZE YOUR FLY CONTROL EFFORTS</strong></h2>
        <p>Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> products offer a complete line of fly traps and attractants, including attractants designed to cater to specific fly species behavior. You can count on the precise design of each fly trap to provide effective control.</p>
        <p>With Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> fly traps and attractants, you can set the bar for fly control at the low, medium, and high levels of your operation and control flies where they feed, mate and rest. On low levels, place the trap on or near the ground. For medium levels, hang the traps along fence lines, near calf hutches and on walls. For high levels, hang the traps from the ceiling or rafters, out of reach of people and livestock.</p>
        <h3>STARBAR FLY TRAPS &ndash; LOW</h3>
        <p>Flies feed near the ground at lower levels. Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> carries fly baits, fly strips, and sticky fly traps to use at this level designed with a variety of built-in attractants that encourage flies to feed and draws them away from problem areas.</p>
        <h3>STARBAR FLY TRAPS &ndash; MEDIUM</h3>
        <p>Flies mate higher than feeding level but lower than resting level. Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> products has a variety of fly traps with attractants that can be placed along fence lines, on walls, and other mid-level areas to lure flies looking to mate in between feeding and resting.</p>
        <h3>STARBAR FLY TRAPS &ndash; HIGH</h3>
        <p>After feeding, flies tend to rest up high in the cooler regions of barns, stables, and other out buildings. Starbar<sup>&reg;</sup> products offers a lineup of fly traps designed to deliver barn fly control up high where most other control methods cannot reach.</p>
