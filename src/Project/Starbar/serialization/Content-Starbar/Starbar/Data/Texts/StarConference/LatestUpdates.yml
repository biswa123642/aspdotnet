        <ul>
            <li>There are currently no vaccination or COVID-19 testing requirements for entering Mexico.</li>
            <li>A negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) is not required for entry.</li>
            <li>Wearing a mask on the airline is not mandatory, it is to your discretion to wear one. It is mandatory to wear a mask in the Puerto Vallarta airport until you are outside the building</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a pen handy on the plane to fill out the Immigration and Declaration Form if you haven&rsquo;t already.</li>
            <li> Once you have proceeded through customs, do not stop in the hallway until you are outside the building, curb side.  Look for the Amstar Rep wearing a Blue Hawaiian Shirt.  If someone stops you and they are not wearing this shirt, just keep moving.  The rep should have a sign with the Star Conference Logo and your name will be on their manifest for the shuttle to the resort.</li>
            <li>Once at the resort, there will be a private Star Conference check in area in the lobby.  Look for the Starbar logo.</li>
        </ul>
