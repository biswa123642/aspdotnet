        <p>Calling Texas FFA and 4H chapters! If you&rsquo;re looking for an opportunity to provide your students a hands-on education in proper agricultural fly control practices, connect with chapters across the state and have multiple opportunities to win great prizes, enroll below for your chance to join the Starbar 101 Fly Control Program.</p>
        <p>Starbar is introducing this program to provide up to 25 FFA or 4H chapters throughout Texas with free fly control products, including educational materials and support. All participating chapters will be given exclusive access to a private Facebook group where they will share their progress and findings with twice-monthly updates beginning with the new school year. These updates must contain photos of the products being used on their farm or of the group using the educational materials provided and two to three sentences describing the content of the posted photo. The Facebook group will also provide a great opportunity to connect with other chapters and learn about their fly control efforts, challenges and successes.</p>
        <p>As an added bonus, Starbar 101 Fly Control Program participants can earn while they learn with chances to win great prizes and scholarships!</p>
        <p>To learn more about the Starbar 101 Fly Control Program, simply complete the brief form below, and we will provide additional details as soon as they are available.</p>
