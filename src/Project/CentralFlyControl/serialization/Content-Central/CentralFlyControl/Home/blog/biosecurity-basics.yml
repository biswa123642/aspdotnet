      Value: "<p>Biosecurity can play a significant role in the success of a swine operation. The purpose of a biosecurity program is to protect animals from foreign pathogens they have not been exposed to. A biosecurity program helps minimize the impact of illnesses that are hard to identify. </p> <p> There are plenty of ways to foster a strong foundation for your biosecurity program. Follow these steps to protect your livestock from harmful diseases spread by flies. </p> <h2>Draw the Line</h2> <p>There&rsquo;s no gray area in biosecurity. Be sure to divide your property into two areas: an inside, clean area and an area outside that&rsquo;s contaminated. Know where to draw that line and stick to it. Create visual reminders by painting or marking the line of division with colored duct tape. </p> <h2>Keep up with cleanliness practices </h2> <p>Your employees play a big role in fortifying your property&rsquo;s biosecurity program. Establish guidelines for clothing and showering. Have dedicated farm clothes and shoes that are exclusively worn inside the barn. Make sure all employees are washing their hands often and honoring the lines you&rsquo;ve drawn up. </p> <h2>Make maintenance a priority </h2> <p>Biosecurity can be threatened by run down equipment. Keep a close eye on your operation&rsquo;s equipment to ensure everything is running correctly. Make sure feed isn&rsquo;t spilling and building up under bins, as that can lead to birds, rodents and other wildlife posing contamination threats. </p> <h2>Enforce your rules </h2> <p>You created biosecurity rules for a reason, make sure everyone sticks to them, even visitors. Be proactive and explain your biosecurity guidelines to any crews, repair people or technicians to ensure they understand them before arriving on your operation. </p> <h2> Stick to your plan when removing culls and mortalities </h2> <p> Make sure you&rsquo;re operating with biosecurity in mind when removing culls or mortalities from the herd. A technique such as staged loading could be a possibility for culls. Be cognizant of the contamination risks associated with rendering trucks. Prioritize cleaning your trailers early on, as it will save time and reduce risk down the road. </p> <h2> Check up on your animals often </h2> <p>Inspect your animals regularly to ensure they&rsquo;re healthy and safe from disease. Vet any new animals before purchasing them to ensure they aren&rsquo;t bringing disease to your property. Consider identifying an area as quarantine zone for any new animals coming onto the farm which is isolated from other animals and shared feed bunks or water sources.</p> <h2>Make your property a no-fly zone</h2> <p> Implementing proper fly control is another pivotal step toward a successful biosecurity program. ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide is the ideal companion for protecting your livestock from disease-carrying flies. As a feed additive, ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide is incorporated into an animal&rsquo;s feed to stop flies in their larval stage. All an employee has to do is add this ingredient to the feed ration. </p> <p>Visit centralflycontrol.com to find out more about how ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide can support your biosecurity program. </p>"
