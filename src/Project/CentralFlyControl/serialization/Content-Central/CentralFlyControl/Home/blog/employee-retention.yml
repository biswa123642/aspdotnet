      Value: "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic turned the work force upside down. Millions of people quit their jobs or were let go due to businesses closing in 2020. This trend has continued in 2022, as 4.3 million people quit their jobs in January 2022 alone. &ldquo;The Great Resignation,&rdquo; as experts are calling it, affects every economic sector, including agriculture. </p> <p>A large part of this phenomenon is that companies are not focused on the needs of their employees. With the uncertainty that COVID-19 brought, employee priorities are changing. And company priorities need to adjust with them. Creating a positive and healthy work environment is necessary for worker satisfaction. When your employees feel supported at work, retention is higher and productivity increases. </p> <p>Creating a positive work environment starts with making the workplace as comfortable as possible and a desire to come to work each day. At swine and dairy operations specifically, flies are one of the primary threats to ensuring employee comfort. With a close proximity to livestock, it is easy for fly populations to grow out of control. Fly infestations can make life unmanageable for your animals and your employees, opening up the possibility to greater employee turnover. Flies aren&rsquo;t just a nuisance either. They can deliver painful bites to your employees and potentially pass on diseases. Fly control is vital not just for the production of livestock, but for the security of the employees. </p> <p>ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide can help protect your animals and people from nuisance flies. As a feed additive, ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide is incorporated into an animal&rsquo;s feed and passes through their manure to stop flies in their larval stage and disrupt their life cycles. Adding this ingredient to an animal&rsquo;s feed ration is all the work an employee needs to do to reduce the threat of disease-carrying fly infestations within an operation. ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide is effective against house flies, stable flies, face flies and horn flies in cattle and house and stable flies in swine, giving you and your employees peace of mind while at work. It&rsquo;s the ideal foundation for any fly management program. </p> <p>Implement ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide at your operation and maintain a comfortable, fly-free environment for your employees. </p>"
