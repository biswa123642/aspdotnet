        <p>No other feed-through fly control product is more versatile than ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide. In fact, ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide is the only feed-through product on the market labeled to control four types of flies on five different animal species. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide is a versatile product that offers producers flexibility in a fly control program,&rdquo; said Reina Lewis, Regional Sales Manager at Central Life Sciences. </p>
        <p>ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide controls the development of horn flies, house flies, stable flies and face flies on cattle, and house and stable flies on sheep, goats, swine and horses. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explain the importance of using ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide to protect your animals from harmful flies. </p>
        <p><strong>Sheep and Goats</strong> </p>
        <p>Before ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide came around, sheep and goat producers were left with few effective options to contain fast-growing fly populations. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Prior to the recent approval of sheep and goats, producers were left with minimal options on how they could control flies on their operation,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;There was not an option for them to prevent the development of new flies using a feed-through.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>Now, producers can simply add ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide to their animals&rsquo; feed and enjoy effective house and stable fly control without directly affecting the health of their livestock.</p>
        <p><strong>Equine</strong></p>
        <p>Stable flies can attack horses in their most vulnerable areas, inflicting painful bites as they draw blood meals. This experience can drastically impact a horse&rsquo;s health, especially if populations get out of control. And if stable or house flies are bothering your horses, they&rsquo;ll be sure to let you know it. </p>
        <p> &ldquo;Every horse owner knows that when their horse is stomping their feet, or they&rsquo;re swishing their tail, they&rsquo;re being attacked by biting flies,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;This makes them uncomfortable and also affects their overall health.&rdquo;</p>
        <p> Incorporating ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide into your equine mineral tubs will help improve quality of life and the environments where they live.</p>
        <p><strong>Cattle</strong> </p>
        <p>Flies are a major concern for cattle producers. They have several fly species to watch for, each of which present their own unique problems. At the very least, flies can irritate cattle enough to make them unproductive.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A dairy producer has several flies that they have to worry about,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;In particular, heavy populations of a house fly can carry several different diseases, such as mastitis, or bovine respiratory disease. These increase veterinary costs for a producer. A dairy producer might also have to deal with biting flies. Stable flies make these cattle uncomfortable, so a high population of stable flies also reduce milk production in dairy cattle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Keep your cattle comfortable and productive from flies by starting ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide in milk and milk replacer at the calf stage and continue to use it through adulthood. This will prevent fly populations from developing in calving hutches and spreading throughout a dairy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Swine</strong> </p>
        <p>Similar to cattle, flies can wreak havoc on swine operations. When fly populations get out of control, they can jeopardize swine health, as well as your bottom line.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Heavy populations of house or stable flies on a swine operation can jeopardize overall production by increasing the spread of diseases and limiting their production,&rdquo; Lewis said. </p>
        <p>Protect your swine from harmful house or stable flies by implementing ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide into your pigs&rsquo; feed to ensure continuous control. </p>
        <p><strong>Use a product you can count on </strong> </p>
        <p>ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide is a feed-through product producers can trust across a wide variety of applications. It serves as an excellent foundation product for any insect pest management (IPM) program.</p>
        <p>ClariFly is a great base product to use in working to control listed flies on an operation,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;As a feed-through product, you&rsquo;re treating those animals&rsquo; manure so that you&rsquo;re not getting fly development in that manure where those flies are laying their eggs. By preventing the development, you&rsquo;re helping to reduce fly populations.&rdquo;</p>
