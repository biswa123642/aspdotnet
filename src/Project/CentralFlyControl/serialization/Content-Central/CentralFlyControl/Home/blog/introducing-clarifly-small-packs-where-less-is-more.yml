        <p>Smaller operations throughout the country often deal with the same problem: having to buy larger feed-through products that cover more ground than they have to offer. </p> <p> The Central Life Sciences team has solved this problem with ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Small Packs, a 3¼  pound bag with a density that ensures proper mixing so that it can be properly distributed throughout your operation. Each ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Small Pack is .67% concentrate and designed to treat a fifty pound bag of loose mineral. </p> <p> Perfect for smaller operations with animals in confinement, ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Small Packs effectively controls stable flies, house flies, horn flies and face flies. These small packs also provide producers with the flexibility to hand mix the product on-site and give them the exact same control they would get through buying ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide that’s already mixed into their feed. They’re the ideal solution for individual producers who may find out that their local dealer has stopped stocking feed-through products at the end of fly season, allowing them to treat individual bags of minerals while giving them a way to treat or keep out the product until after their last frost. </p> <p>As the warmer weather approaches, it is important for smaller operators to remember the Central Life Sciences 30/30 approach to feed-through fly control using ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Small Packs. These fly control guidelines recommend starting ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide 30 days before average daily temperatures typically reach 65 degrees, and continuing it through 30 days past the first frost in fall. The 30/30 approach helps account for the variability in weather patterns to maximize control of overwintering fly pupae. By beginning Clarifly<sup>®</sup> Small Packs 30 days before spring weather hits, you can significantly limit fly infestations at the start of the season, allowing for more effective control throughout the peak summer season and into fall. </p> <p>With ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Small Packs, smaller producers are getting a more cost-effective solution that provides the exact same level of fly control they’ve come to expect.</p><br /><iframe width="499" height="325" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0JkcchaeYmM" title="ClariFly Small Packs: Where Less is More | Central Life Sciences" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
