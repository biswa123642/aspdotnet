        <p>Fly management programs, on farms that handle livestock such as sheep and goats, need to be proactive. Fly populations can grow quickly and spread to neighboring operations and communities. When stable fly populations reach 50 to 60 flies per animal, you can see a dramatic reduction in performance. ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide will not directly affect livestock health or production, but it will take care of the nuisance flies that do.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Contact your feed distributor today to implement ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide Livestock Premix 0.67% into feed to help protect your sheep and goats from flies.</p>
