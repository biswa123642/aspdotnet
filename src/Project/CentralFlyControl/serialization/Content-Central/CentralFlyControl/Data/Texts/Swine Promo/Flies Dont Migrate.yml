        <h1><strong>FLIES DON&rsquo;T MIGRATE IN THE WINTER</strong></h1>
        <em>Protect Your Swine Operation with ClariFly&reg; Larvicide, Now with a New Inclusion Rate for Gestating Sows<br />
        <br />
        </em>
        <p><strong>Protect against Disease-Carrying Flies by Feeding ClariFly&reg; Larvicide</strong></p>
        <span>Flies, such as the dark-eyed fruit fly, remain an issue throughout the winter in swine operations. Combine ClariFly&reg; Larvicide 267 with proper IPM practices in breeding, gestation, and farrowing buildings, as well as nurseries and finishers to maximize protection against flies and Indian meal moths.</span><br style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;" />
        <br />
        <p><strong>Get Continuous Fly Control</strong></p>
        <span>Flies can transmit diseases including PEDV to pigs.</span><br style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;" />
        <br />
        <span>ClariFly&reg; Larvicide 267 helped one finishing swine operation achieve a 99% reduction in house flies.</span><br />
        <br />
        <strong>NEW</strong><span>&nbsp;clearance for gestating sows makes ClariFly&reg; Larvicide 267 even more affordable to maximize protection against flies.</span>
