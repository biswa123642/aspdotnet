        <h2>House Fly</h2>
        </div>
        <p>House flies are non-metallic, dull grayish colored flies, approximately 6 - 7 mm in length with 4 distinct stripes on their thorax. The abdomen of the house fly is usually a pale color with yellowish sides and underside. Female house flies lay 1 mm long, slightly curved, whitish colored eggs that are normally deposited in batches of approximately 150 eggs in animal manure, wet organic matter, spilled feed, compost piles, decaying fruit and various other potential larval development areas.</p>
        <p>The larvae of the house fly hatch within 24 hours, are white in color and feed on waste. The larvae will grow and eventually migrate away from the food source to drier areas to pupate. Pupae are dark brown.</p>
        <p>The pupal stage will last anywhere from 3 to 10 days depending on temperature. Adults emerge from the puparium and begin feeding within 24 hours with sponging type mouthparts and the life cycle is repeated.</p>
