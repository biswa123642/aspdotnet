        <h2>Face Fly</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Face flies resemble the house fly, but may be slightly larger and grayish in color. Face flies have 4 stripes on their thorax and sponging type mouthparts like the house fly. Females look very similar to the house fly, while male face flies have abdomens that are yellowish-orange in color. Female face flies lay eggs only on fresh, undisturbed cattle manure and are primarily considered a pastured cattle pest.</p>
        <p>Larvae hatch from the eggs and feed under the dung crust. Once fully developed, the larvae disperse in surrounding soil to pupate. Adult face flies feed on secretions around the eyes, nose and mouth of cattle.</p>
        <p>In the fall, newly emerged adults, stimulated by shortened days and cooler temperatures, go into diapause to delay reproduction until the following spring when temperatures are more favorable to survival of immatures. Often times, diapausing face fly adults are found in large numbers in attics of buildings and are referred to as cluster flies.</p>
