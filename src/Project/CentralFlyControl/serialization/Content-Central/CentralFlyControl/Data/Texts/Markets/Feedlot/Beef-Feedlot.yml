        <h1>Beef-Feedlot</h1>
        <p>Adding ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide in a feedlot's mix is a consistent way to ensure that there is always something being done to control nuisance flies. Because of the nature of the confinement and the constant rotation of cattle, fly control can be a challenge on a feedlot. Unchecked, fly populations can grow quickly and have a direct effect on cattle feeding and weight gain. Diligent attention to integrated pest management (IPM) practices and ClariFly<sup>®</sup> Larvicide can help keep feedlot cattle fly free and on feed.</p>
        <p>Contact your feed distributor today to implement ClariFly® Larvicide into feed to help protect your cattle from flies.</p>
