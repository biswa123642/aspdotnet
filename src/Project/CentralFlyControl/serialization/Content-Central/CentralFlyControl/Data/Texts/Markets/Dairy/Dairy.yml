        <p>Nuisance flies are a vector of disease and an irritant to cattle on a dairy operation, as well as to the people that work on the operation. Because of the confined nature of a dairy, it is important that ClariFly&reg; Larvicide is part of an integrated pest management (IPM) program for effectively controlling fly populations. To be fully effective, it is important to start ClariFly&reg; Larvicide in milk and milk replacer at the calf stage and continue it through adulthood. If you don&rsquo;t, the flies that start in calving hutches can quickly spread throughout a dairy, making all IPM efforts ineffective.</p>
        <p>Contact your feed distributor today to implement ClariFly&reg; Larvicide into feed to help protect your dairy cows from flies.</p>
