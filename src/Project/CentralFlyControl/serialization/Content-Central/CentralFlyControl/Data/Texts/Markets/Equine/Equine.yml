        <p>Equine fly control is not so much an issue of economics as it is quality of life. Fly populations can get out of control quickly, it is important to have an integrated pest management program (IPM) in place that includes ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide. Parasitic flies attack horses in areas where they are not able to defend themselves, inflicting painful bites as they draw blood meals. This severely affects equine comfort and can be a threat to their health. Incorporating Clarifly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide into your equine mineral tubs will help improve the life of your animal as well as the environments where they live.</p>
        <p>Contact your feed distributor today to implement ClariFly&reg; Larvicide into feed to help protect your horses from flies.</p>
