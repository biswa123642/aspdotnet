        <p>Ranchers need to do everything they can to protect their investment.  Part of that should be controlling flies with ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide in the feed mix for time on pasture. Flies spread disease, hinder productivity, and cause stress - all of which can have an effect on beef cattle profitability. In a confined situation, house flies, stable flies, horn flies and face flies could all have an impact on beef cattle development.  When ClariFly<sup>&reg;</sup> Larvicide is part of an integrated pest management (IPM) program, fly populations can be controlled and beef cattle can continue to develop profitably.</p>
        <p>Contact your feed distributor today to implement ClariFly&reg; Larvicide into feed to help protect your cattle from flies.</p>
