        <br /><h3>Hardy Fish</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Danios are schooling fish in the Family Cyprinidae. Most species grow to less than 2" and are typically surface oriented. A few types, like dangila and giant danios, can reach 5" in length. Danios are incredibly hardy and tolerate a wide range of temperature and water chemistry, making them excellent fish for beginners and newly set up aquariums. They are active, to the point of being boisterous, but rarely cause injury to other fish. Several color variants and long-finned versions have been developed through selective breeding. White cloud mountain minnows are included in the danio group as they are closely related fish that come from the same region and have the same aquarium needs.</span></p> <h3>A Danio's Natural Habitat</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Danios are native to South and Southeast Asia. Habitat varies from fast flowing streams to quiet pools. In recent years, a number of new species have been discovered in remote areas of Myanmar (Burma) and have been introduced into the hobby.</span></p> <h3>Water Requirements for Danios</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Most danios tolerate a wide range of water chemistry and temperature, making them ideal beginner fish. pH should be between 7.0 and 7.8, alkalinity between 3&deg; and 8&deg; dkH (50 ppm to 140 ppm) and temperature between 70&deg; and 78&deg; F. If the aquarium is kept in rooms below 70&deg;, use an Aqueon Aquarium Heater to maintain the correct temperature. Maintain good filtration and change 10% of the water each week or 25% every 2 weeks using an Aqueon Aquarium Water Changer or Aqueon Siphon Vacuum Gravel Cleaner. Don't forget to treat tap water with Aqueon Water Conditioner before refilling your tank!</span></p> <h3>Housing Recommendations for Danios</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Long tanks with ample swimming room are best. Strong current from the filter or additional circulation pumps helps replicate their riverine habitat. Most danios are surface oriented, so having tall plants or ones that float at the top help make them feel at home. They will be less stressed and show their best colors in a well decorated aquarium. Danios are best kept in schools of at least 6 or more. Keep a secure lid on the aquarium to prevent them from jumping out.</span></p> <h3>Danios Behavior/Compatibility</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Danios are always on the go and should be kept with other active fish. Good tankmates include serpae, red eye and #545557 skirt tetras, platies, mollies and swordtails, small barbs and other danios. Always consult an aquarium expert before buying any new fish for your aquarium.</span></p> <h3>What Do Danios Eat?</h3> <p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 7.5pt;"><span style="color: #545557;">Most danios are omnivorous and will thrive on Aqueon Tropical Flakes, Color Flakes, Tropical Granules and Shrimp Pellets. Frozen and live foods can also be fed as treats or to help induce spawning. For best results, rotate their diet daily and feed only what they can consume in under 2 minutes, once or twice a day.</span></p> <h3>Danios Breeding Level - Intermediate</h3> <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #545557;">Danios can be bred in captivity, but some extra care is required to raise fry to adults. Danios are egg scattering fish that commonly spawn in groups, however, a single male/female pair can also breed. As with many fish, there is a possibility of the parents eating their eggs after they are laid. The chances for fry to survive increase if the eggs are separated from the adults.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
