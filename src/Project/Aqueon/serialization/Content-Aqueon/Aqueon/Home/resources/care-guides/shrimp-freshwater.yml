From the basic ghost shrimp (<em>Palaemonetes paludosus</em>) that are typically sold as feeder shrimp, to the well-known Amano or algae-eating shrimp (<em>Caridina multidentata</em>), to the popular red cherry shrimp (<em>Neocaridina heteropoda</em>), to crystal and bee shrimp (<em>Caridina cantonensis</em>), to the filter-feeding bamboo shrimp (Atyopsis moluccensis<em>),&nbsp;</em>the list of shrimp for aquarists to consider continues to grow. Regardless of one's budget or experience level, dwarf freshwater shrimp offer something unique and truly different for aquarists with small to medium-sized aquariums.</span></p> <h3><strong>Freshwater Shrimp Water Requirements</strong></h3> <p><span style="color: #545557;">Water requirements for dwarf freshwater shrimp vary depending on species, although ammonia and nitrites should always be undetectable, and nitrates should be below 10 ppm. Ghost shrimp, along with Amano and bamboo shrimp are not particular about pH or alkalinity as long as extremes are avoided and can be kept in dechlorinated tap water. The same can be said for red cherry shrimp. Most crystal and bee shrimp require soft, low pH water, while&nbsp;<em>Caridina</em>&nbsp;shrimp from Sulawesi need a higher pH and alkalinity, along with higher temperatures. It is best to research the water requirements of the species you intend to keep before purchasing them. When using plant supplements or medications, avoid products containing copper, as it is toxic to freshwater shrimp. Maintain good filtration and do a 10% to 20% water exchange every week using an Aqueon Aquarium Water Changer or Siphon Vacuum Gravel Cleaner. For soft water species, use reverse osmosis or deionized water supplemented with Aqueon Water Renewal. Don't forget to treat tap water with Aqueon Water Conditioner before refilling your aquarium!</span></p> <h3><strong>Housing Requirements for Freshwater Shrimp</strong></h3> <p>Larger species such as ghost, Amano and bamboo shrimp can be kept in aquariums of 10 to 55 gallons, while red cherry, crystal and bee shrimp are better suited to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=72fe0d591e7b4fc5b1f129edd7c4673c&amp;_z=z">aquariums of 10 gallons or less</a>. If using a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2b7a7722b73a45d7bebf4d91fe16029c&amp;_z=z">hang-on (HOB) or canister filter</a>, slide a sponge pre-filter over the intake screen to prevent shrimp from being sucked into the filter. Dedicated shrimp breeders typically use air driven sponge filters. Live plants are recommended, particularly species such as Java moss or <em>Najas</em>. Substrate should be pH neutral (inert) or an aquatic plant medium. There are a number of substrate materials designed specifically for dwarf freshwater shrimp keeping. Mature aquariums are preferred as they are more stable and tend to have natural food sources for shrimp; never place dwarf freshwater shrimp in a newly set up aquarium! <strong></strong></p> <h3><strong>Freshwater Shrimp Behavior/Compatibility</strong></h3> <p><span style="color: #545557;">Dwarf freshwater shrimp are active and almost always engaged in harvesting algae or some other food source. Most species stay relatively small, so they are vulnerable to predation by larger fish. Many shrimp enthusiasts set up dedicated shrimp aquariums with no fish at all, however, some species of freshwater shrimp can be kept with small, non-aggressive, non-predatory fish such as:</span></p> <div> </div> <p> <span><br clear="all" /> </span></p> <div> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Emerald dwarf rasboras</span></li>     <li><em><span style="color: #545557;">Boraras</span></em><span style="color: #545557;">&nbsp;rasboras </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Celestial danios </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Ember tetras </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Endlers livebearers </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Sparkling gouramis </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Blue-eyed rainbowfish </span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Otocinclus</span></li>     <li><span style="color: #545557;">Pygmy corydoras catfish</span></li> </ul> </div> <p /> <p><span style="color: #545557;"> <br /> Dwarf freshwater shrimp can also be kept with&nbsp;<em>Nerite</em>&nbsp;and other snail species. Avoid combining different species of the same genus of dwarf freshwater shrimp in the same aquarium to prevent cross-breeding. In other words, don't keep two different species of&nbsp;<em>Neocaridina</em>&nbsp;together, but you can mix a&nbsp;<em>Neocaridina</em>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<em>Caridina</em>.</span></p> <h3><strong>What Do Freshwater Shrimp Eat?</strong></h3> <p><span style="color: #545557;">Dwarf freshwater shrimp are largely algae eaters, however, they will eagerly accept virtually any&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #545557;"><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2656c968c7e1409c97ab2e799afb35f9&amp;_z=z"><span style="color: #545557;">food</span></a></span><span style="color: #545557;">&nbsp;offered. Withholding food one day a week helps them cleanse their digestive systems and encourages them to do more aquarium cleaning. Bamboo shrimp are filter feeders that like to sit in a current and trap micro-organisms and fine particles such as ground flake or pellet food on their fans. Dwarf freshwater shrimp can be fed Aqueon Tropical Flakes, Spirulina Flakes, Algae Rounds, Shrimp Pellets, Bottom Feeder Tablets, Tropical Color Flakes and Tropical Granules. For best results, rotate their diet daily and feed only what they can consume in 2 to 3 minutes, once or twice a day.</span></p> <h3><strong>Freshwater Shrimp Breeding &ndash; Easy to Difficult</strong></h3> <p><span style="color: #545557;">Many dwarf freshwater shrimp breed readily in captivity, however, success varies from species to species. Red cherry shrimp and certain other <em>Neocaridina</em>, for example, can quickly develop into large colonies with no assistance from the aquarist. Crystal and bee shrimp are a bit more difficult, while others, such as Amano shrimp are nearly impossible, as they require brackish water to breed successfully. Research should be done before any breeding is attempted.</span></p>
