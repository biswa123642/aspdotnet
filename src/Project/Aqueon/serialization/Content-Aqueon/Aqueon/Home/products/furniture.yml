      Hint: Content

        <p>Placing your aquarium on an manufacturer-built stand means it has been designed to support the weight of the aquarium in addition to bringing an attractive furniture element. Aqueon stands are made of durable, water-resistant materials with the expectation that they will be set up for long periods of time and will come in contact with water. They also provide generous space for storage and easy access to plumbing, lighting and accessories. </p>
        <p><strong>PRO Tip </strong>- Aquariums weight about 10 pounds per gallon, so be sure the base is level and does not wobble if placed on an uneven floor. </p>
