        <br /><p><strong>DO'S</strong></p> <ul>     <li>Have your tap water tested for pH, alkalinity, nitrate and phosphate to make sure it is acceptable for aquarium use.</li>     <li>Buy the largest aquarium you can afford or have space for. Larger aquariums are more stable and easier to maintain.</li>     <li>Let a newly set up aquarium run for 2 to 3 days before purchasing your first fish.</li>     <li>Test the aquarium water for pH, ammonia and nitrite before adding new fish.</li>     <li>Always acclimate new fish purchases before introducing them to your aquarium.</li>     <li>Research all animals before purchasing to make sure you have the right food, environment and skills to maintain them.</li>     <li>Research all equipment before purchasing to make sure it is right for your setup and tank inhabitants.</li>     <li>Change 10% of your aquarium water every week or 25% every two weeks. Replacement water should be the same temperature as the aquarium water.</li>     <li>Always treat tap water with a water conditioner to neutralize chlorine and ammonia before adding it to the aquarium.</li>     <li>Change filter cartridges at least once a month. Check them weekly and rinse as needed.</li>     <li>Inspect your fish for health on a regular basis. A good time to do this is when you feed.</li>     <li>Feed your fish a variety of flake, pellet and frozen foods to make sure they are getting proper nutrition.</li>     <li>Always purchase schooling fish like tetras, barbs, rasboras and danios in groups of 6 or more to ensure their health and well-being.</li> </ul> <p><strong>DON'TS</strong></p> <ul>     <li>Don't completely tear down your aquarium to clean it. This will destroy the biological balance with disastrous results.</li>     <li>Avoid water changes of more than 25% as larger water changes can stress your fish and upset the balance in your aquarium.</li>     <li>Don't leave the aquarium light on 24/7. This not only stresses your fish but can lead to excessive algae growth.</li>     <li>Don't place your aquarium near a sunny window or in a drafty location.</li>     <li>Don't buy fish the same day you purchase the aquarium. Instead, set the tank up and let it run for a few days before bringing your first fish home.</li>     <li>Don't purchase fish on impulse. Make sure they won't outgrow your tank, are compatible with existing tank inhabitants and you have the right food, equipment and skills to maintain them.</li>     <li>Don't allow store water to enter your aquarium when adding new fish.</li>     <li>Don't add too many fish at one time, especially in smaller or newly set up aquariums.</li>     <li>Don't overstock your aquarium. Fish that are crowded may fight, and overstocking can lead to water quality problems.</li>     <li>Don't feed more than your fish can consume in under 2 minutes. Uneaten food can pollute the water and stress your fish.</li>     <li>Don't buy equipment based on price only. Make sure it will do the job you are asking it to do and will last.</li>     <li>Don't use buckets, scrub pads or any other equipment on your aquarium that have been used with soap or other chemicals.</li> </ul> <p>Please <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=35DB89B885B942CB8A77C7A4F3B81907&amp;_z=z">join our newsletter</a>, connect with us on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/AqueonProducts/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C67A47E0AE2A4A7EB5DA000EF0FA7982&amp;_z=z">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
