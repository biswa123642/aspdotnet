        <p>Aquariums can be a lot of fun and they're great teaching tools for kids. They're also a nice diversion from the TV and other electronic devices. Many aquarium "Lifers" got their start with aquariums as children and have continued to keep them into adulthood. Regardless of whether you're an old hand or have never owned an aquarium yourself, proper planning is the best recipe for success when introducing your child to aquarium keeping. Before you head down to your local pet shop for an aquarium starter kit, here are a few things worth considering.</p>
        <h3>Be Prepared</h3>
        <p>If you're a veteran aquarist, you'll know what to look for and how to select the right equipment. But if this is new to you, or it's been a few years since you had your own aquarium, here is a list of things you'll need for your kid's fish tank:</p>
        <table style="width: 816px; height: 85px;">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Aquarium</td>
                    <td>Gravel</td>
                    <td>Net</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cover and Light</td>
                    <td>Decorations</td>
                    <td>Algae Scraper </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Heater and Thermometer</td>
                    <td>Food</td>
                    <td>Aerator (Optional)</td>

        <h3>How to Choose A Starter Fish Tank: Size and Shape</h3>
        <p>There's a natural tendency to want to start small, especially when kids are involved. For one thing, smaller aquariums cost less, plus it's easier to find a place to put them. Many novices think a smaller tank will be easier and less complicated to take care of, but actually the opposite is true. Larger aquariums are more stable and more forgiving of beginner mistakes. When things go wrong &ndash; as sometimes happens in the beginning &ndash; they typically happen quickly and often with disastrous results in a smaller aquarium. That doesn't mean you should start your youngster out with a 55 gallon setup (although they probably wouldn't object to the idea), it just means that unless you're planning to have a Betta and nothing more, a 10 or 20 gallon tank is a better choice than a tiny desktop aquarium. Aquarium shape is important too; long wide aquariums hold more fish and offer better gas exchange than tall narrow ones. Start with the largest aquarium you have room for and your budget allows.</p>
        <h3>Should You Choose A Glass or Acrylic Fish Tank?</h3>
        <p>Another consideration is whether to go with a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6C9591BBC2FC4821963DCBA8D97DD844&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">glass or acrylic aquarium</a>; each has pros and cons. Glass tanks don't warp or scratch easily, they're less expensive and hold up better over time. They are, however, more susceptible to breakage. Acrylic tanks are lighter, albeit more expensive, and are more resistant to toys and other objects sailing across the room into them. However, the entire bottom of an acrylic tank must be supported, not just the edges as with glass.</p>
        <h3>Choosing Between Freshwater and Saltwater</h3>
        <p>Most people automatically choose freshwater because it's simpler and less expensive, however, depending on your child's age and what your budget is, this may be a legitimate question. Don't rule saltwater out, especially if your child demonstrates the aptitude and is old enough to take on some of the responsibilities of maintaining a marine aquarium. Saltwater aquariums are much easier to keep than they were years ago, and as with most things in life, there are different levels of difficulty and associated cost. You can start out with a basic saltwater aquarium that houses a few hardy fish, and grow from there. And who doesn't love Nemo? Turn key marine aquarium kits like the Coralife LED Bio-Cube 16 and 32, and 29 gallon Fish Only Marine Kit make having a saltwater aquarium possible for any home aquarist willing to put in the effort.</p>
        <h3>Where Should You Put An Aquarium?</h3>
        <p>Before heading off to the local fish store, decide where your new aquarium will go. How much space do you have? Is there an electrical outlet nearby? Do you have a sturdy base to set it on? Keep in mind, a fully set up aquarium weighs about 10 lbs per gallon. Aquariums of 10 gallons or less can be placed on sturdy furniture, but a factory built aquarium stand is best for larger tanks. Avoid placing the aquarium near a window that gets direct sunlight to prevent overheating and excessive algae growth. The aquarium should be at eye level for children and away from drafts or doors that might bump it when they open. Consider these <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=30425946EFC049A382DC798E6B88274C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">additional aquarium do's and don'ts</a>.</p>
        <h3>The Best Fish For Kids Fish Tank?</h3>
        <p>There are two approaches here. If you've already purchased a children's fish tank, ask your local fish store expert to point out appropriate fish after you have it set up. On the other hand, if you haven't decided on a specific size yet, plan an outing to your local aquarium shop and wander the aisles. Ask the staff to recommend good starter fish for kids and let your son or daughter choose the type of fish he or she wants. Then have the store staff help you choose the appropriate tank size and shape to accommodate them. Active fish, for example, do best in wide aquariums where they have room to swim, while more sedentary fish will be perfectly happy in a narrower aquarium like a hexagon. A word of caution: Never buy fish on the same day as the aquarium. Take the tank home, get it set up and wait at least 48 hours before buying your first fish.

        <p><strong>Novelty Tanks </strong></p>
        <p>Be wary of "gimmicky" aquarium kits that feature cartoon characters, movie themes or TV shows as the selling point. Often the focus of these setups is the "theme" and while they may appeal to kids, they often lack adequate equipment, may be difficult to clean, or are otherwise impractical for keeping tropical fish long term. You're better off buying a quality aquarium kit and letting your child decorate it with aquarium-safe ornaments of their choosing.</p>
        <p><strong>Boxed Kits</strong></p>
        <p>If you're starting from scratch, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7fe72f3783dc41b496b8f961e3731e74&amp;_z=z">boxed aquarium kits</a> are the best way to go. They come in sizes from 10 to 55 gallons and typically include the aquarium, cover and light, filter, heater, thermometer, water conditioner and food samples, and setup guide, all at a significantly reduced price over buying each item separately. You aren't limited to the basic rectangular tank, either. Aqueon&reg; offers <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7fe72f3783dc41b496b8f961e3731e74&amp;_z=z">Bowfront, Hexagon and Ascent aquariums</a> as starter kits in addition to the traditional rectangular models. If you're outfitting an existing aquarium, don't skimp on vital life support equipment like filter, heater and air pump to save money. The adage you get what you pay for applies here.</p>
        <h3>Fish Tank Decorations</h3>
        <p>Fish need lots of structure to feel safe and find a place to live. Kids will naturally want brightly colored gravel and decorations. But these items don't always represent what fish experience in nature and certain decorations may even stress them. Instead of making the choice for your child, discuss what's in the best interest of the fish with them and what their natural environment looks like. Decorating a fish tank for kids doesn't have to be boring, help them choose decorations that will be in the best interest of the fish, but are still what they want.</p>
        <p>Getting kids involved in aquarium keeping has many benefits, and making sure they're set up for success right from the start will help make it fun for everyone. With proper planning you can help them begin a lifelong involvement in one of the most exciting hobbies in the world!</p>
