While the betta fish's lifespan might be shorter than you like, there are things you can do to help your betta live the longest, fullest life possible.</p> <h2>Betta Fish Have Short Lifespans</h2> <p>Betta fish typically have short lifespans of about <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pets.webmd.com/how-long-do-betta-fish-live#1" target="_blank">two to four years</a> on average. With care, your betta fish might live as long as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bettafishrescue.org/pros-and-cons-of-owning-betta-fish/" target="_blank">five years</a>. So don't be hard on yourself if your betta doesn't live longer than that. Five years is considered old age for a betta and an achievement you should take pride in.</p> <h2>Six Tips to Help Your Betta Live a Longer Life</h2> <p>You can do quite a few things to help your betta live a long and happy life. While none of these tips guarantee a longer lifespan, they can help.</p> <h3>1. Choose Wisely</h3> <p>The first step happens when you purchase your fish. Look for a healthy betta that isn't discolored and doesn't have damaged fins. Ensure the other fish in the tank aren't sick, and check that the tank isn't dirty.</p> <h3>2. Give Your Betta a Larger Tank</h3> <p>Sure, you may see betta swimming in tiny bowls or vases in pet stores, but this isn't the ideal setup for betta fish. Look for a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cafishvet.com/betta/how-long-do-betta-fish-live/" target="_blank">bigger tank</a> &mdash; ideally, one that's at least five gallons in size and has a heater and filter. A <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D1434AC8DDDE4FEE9D6AD024FEB0C2FE&amp;_z=z">happy betta</a>&nbsp;is a healthy betta.</p> <h3>3. Keep the Water Warm and Clean</h3> <p>The tank environment can play a big role in your betta's health and lifespan. Look for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=31AE9668B8004D2EB88F3C67891CF9BB&amp;_z=z">low-flow filters</a>&nbsp;so your betta's delicate fins aren't injured.<br /> <br /> Strive to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vetmed.illinois.edu/pet-health-columns/betta-fish/" target="_blank">maintain a water temperature</a> of 76&deg; to 81&deg;F. Then watch the water to ensure it stays clean and keep an eye out for fungal or bacterial issues.<br /> <br /> The type of water can also impact your fish's lifespan. Deionized water is ideal, and avoid distilled water since it lacks minerals. And never use straight tap water. Tap water should always be dechlorinated and tested for heavy metals. Invest in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4246D639884240CFA0715A67214D4296&amp;_z=z">water conditioners</a>&nbsp;to make sure your tap water is safe.</p> <h3>4. Feed Your Betta Well</h3> <p>A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cafishvet.com/betta/how-long-do-betta-fish-live/" target="_blank">nutritious diet</a> can help your betta live longer. Look for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0A1C026AA79C4279A8F08DE492D1843C&amp;_z=z">betta food</a>&nbsp;high in protein, not fat. Feed small meals rather than one big meal to guard against overfeeding. Constipation can actually kill a betta.<br /> <br /> A betta's stomach is about the size of its eye. A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-to-feed-your-betta-fish-5207803" target="_blank">good rule of thumb</a> is to feed your betta about an eyeful at a time. If <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pets.webmd.com/what-do-betta-fish-eat" target="_blank">feeding pellets</a>, aim for two to four pellets once or twice a day.<br /> <br /> Fresh or freeze-dried food can also be used once or twice a week. Betta love hunting, so <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pets.webmd.com/how-long-do-betta-fish-live#" target="_blank">consider including</a> mosquito larvae, brine shrimp, or bloodworms as part of their meals.</p> <h3>5. Give Your Betta Places to Rest and Lots of Plants</h3> <p>The right tank environment can help your betta's lifespan. Keep the decorations minimal, so there's still room to swim freely and make sure they aren't sharp.<br /> <br /> Live plants <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-safe-for-betta-fish-5210886" target="_blank">are an even better choice</a> for tank decor since they also help <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pets.webmd.com/how-long-do-betta-fish-live#1" target="_blank">keep the water quality healthy</a>. When choosing a live plant, look for ones that don't have pointy or sharp edges that could tear your betta's fragile fins. Plants gentle on your fish's fins include Hornwort and Naja grass.<br /> <br /> If you prefer artificial plants, silk varieties that say "betta safe" will be gentler on betta fins.<br /> <br /> Betta rest a lot since they need quite a bit of energy for their tiny bodies to hold up those big, fancy fins. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cafishvet.com/betta/how-long-do-betta-fish-live/" target="_blank">Soft artificial leaves</a> attached to tank walls with suction cups can make nice rest stops.</p> <h3>6. Don't Add Other Betta</h3> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vetmed.illinois.edu/pet-health-columns/betta-fish/" target="_blank">Don't add another betta</a> as a tank companion. Betta are territorial and tend to fight, which could shorten your fish's lifespan. If you really need tank mates, consider ghost shrimp, snails, or African dwarf frogs. If you really want to add a fish, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D6FC5D160C22426B86205D5F19344614&amp;_z=z">do your research</a>&nbsp;to find compatible ones. You can even <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3DFEDEC212294B74AC17E57FB08D3025&amp;_z=z">play with your betta</a>&nbsp;yourself to keep the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F424B695E50842E6B5BC11510E349A01&amp;_z=z">environment enriching</a>, so your betta doesn't get bored.<br /> <br /> Betta fish are beautiful creatures that create a peaceful, serene ambiance in your home. With the right gentle care, your betta can live a long and happy life.</p>
