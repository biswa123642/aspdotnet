        <br /><p><img alt="An ideal set up for a betta fish tank doesn't look like the fancy containers you see at the local pet shop." src="-/media/8B2E591CEBA848A98B1DB0683A3CE393.ashx?h=300&amp;w=451" style="height: 300px; width: 451px;" /><br /> <br /> Betta fish are a perfect choice for both new fish owners and seasoned experts. Their stunning colors and delicate, large fins make a great addition to any home. If you've decided to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D1434AC8DDDE4FEE9D6AD024FEB0C2FE&amp;_z=z">get a new betta</a>, you want to ensure your betta fish tank setup is ideal for an enriching, healthy life. This guide will help you get started.</p> <h2>What Size Betta Tank Do You Need?</h2> <p>Although pet stores are known to sell betta fish in tiny bowls or narrow vases, this isn't the best choice for your betta.<br /> <br /> In fact, the idea that betta like these environments comes from a misunderstanding of their biology. Betta fish have a <a href="https://bettasource.com/betta-labyrinth-organ/">labyrinth organ</a> that lets them process air from the surface in addition to their gills. This means that, in a pinch, they can survive in a less hospitable, shallow environment. But they don't prefer tiny spaces.<br /> <br /> Betta fish are happiest when they have room to spread their wings (or, more precisely, their glorious fins). This means they need a tank with plenty of space to swim and thrive.</p> <h2>The Ideal Filter and Water for Your Tank Setup</h2> <p>Betta fish are hardy, but they can be sensitive to bacteria buildup. So make sure you have clean water and a good filtration system.</p> <h3>1. Use Conditioned Water</h3> <p>First, don't pour tap water into your aquarium. This can be dangerous to your sensitive betta. Deionized water is ideal — the water should be soft. If you use distilled or tap water, be sure to add a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4246D639884240CFA0715A67214D4296&amp;_z=z">betta water conditioner</a>&nbsp;to restore essential minerals.</p> <h3>2. Keep the Water Warm</h3> <p>Bettas are sensitive to temperature, so you'll need a heater that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vetmed.illinois.edu/pet-health-columns/betta-fish/" target="_blank">keeps the water</a> at about 76 to 81° Fahrenheit. Your beautiful tropical betta will thank you for your attentiveness.</p> <h3>3. Low-Flow Filters Are Ideal</h3> <p>Look for a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=31AE9668B8004D2EB88F3C67891CF9BB&amp;_z=z">low-flow filter</a>. Strong currents might hurt your fish's fragile fins, and a low-flow filter will provide gentle currents your betta will enjoy.</p> <h3>4. Lighting Should Mimic Day-Night Cycles</h3> <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/pets/how-do-betta-fish-sleep-48246812">Don't leave the tank lights on</a> all the time. Betta fish prefer day-night cycles just like you do, so turn off the lights at night.</p> <h3>5. Make Sure the Tank Has a Cover</h3> <p>Betta can unintentionally jump out of a tank without a cover. So, make sure your tank has a secure lid.</p> <h2>Choosing Decorations and Plants for Your Betta</h2> <p>Your last step in setting up the perfect environment for your betta is making sure the decorations and plants are betta friendly. Your betta's beautiful fins are <a href="https://bettafishrescue.org/how-to-set-up-a-betta-tank/">quite fragile</a>. So when <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-safe-for-betta-fish-5210886" target="_blank">choosing plants</a>, steer clear of artificial or live plants with sharp or pointy edges that can tear your betta's fins.<br /> <br /> If using artificial plants, look for the betta-safe silk variety. Your fish might like a betta hammock that attaches to the side of your tank, giving your fish a place to rest.<br /> <br /> You might also choose soft, live plants to help water quality and control algae. Anubias is one good variety. Hornwort and Naja grass are also nice choices.<br /> <br /> Don't forget to include decorations<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pethelpful.com/fish-aquariums/Betta-Fish-Tank-Ideas-for-Your-Home-or-Office" target="_blank"> where your betta can hide</a> if stressed. A cave with a large entrance that doesn't snag your betta's fins is a nice choice.</p> <h2>What About Tank Mates?</h2> <p>What about <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.petmd.com/fish/care/evr_fi_how-to-take-care-of-betta-fish" target="_blank">tank mates</a>? Can betta <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D6FC5D160C22426B86205D5F19344614&amp;_z=z">get lonely</a>?<br /> <br /> Betta are quite territorial, so don't add another betta to your tank. And sometimes, other species of fish might bite and damage your betta's fins. If you want tank mates, consider <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=327FDE9B95E9465CA7E635D45963394E&amp;_z=z">bottom-dwelling varieties</a>. A kuhli loach or corydoras catfish could make a nice, gentle choice. If you go with the corydoras catfish, they need to be kept in groups, so make sure your tank is large enough to support them.<br /> <br /> And don't forget to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3DFEDEC212294B74AC17E57FB08D3025&amp;_z=z">play with your betta</a>&nbsp;to keep them from getting lonely in the tank.<br /> <br /> Taking care of a betta fish is pretty easy, as long as you have all the right pieces in place. Look for soft plants, low-current filters, a large tank with lights on a day-night cycle, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0A1C026AA79C4279A8F08DE492D1843C&amp;_z=z">special betta food</a>. This combination will keep your beautiful betta happy and healthy.</p>
