        <br /><p>Many of us can remember the delight of jumping into one of those ball pit amusements as kids.&nbsp; Or maybe we enjoy watching our children play in them today.&nbsp; Well just like kids, bettas could use some amusement in their lives.&nbsp; <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C3D02E7588AA488B972A3B73F2277EA7&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Aqueon PURE Betta Beads&trade;</a>&nbsp;provide just that sort of amusement. Aqueon PURE Betta Beads&trade; are lightweight, colored, biodegradable balls that provide a new and exciting substrate for bettas.</p> <h2>Hard Gravel Alternative</h2> <p>Ever since bettas were first kept in aquariums, the choices of substrates have been limiting.&nbsp; You could go with no substrate at all, a hard and heavy gravel, or glass or plastic marbles.&nbsp; There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these.&nbsp; Aqueon PURE Betta Beads&trade; offers a new and enriching alternative.&nbsp; Ideally suited for small aquariums that do not have active filtration, the beads are soft and lightweight balls that sink to the bottom to form a soft layer of substrate for bettas to rest on.&nbsp; They will not scrape or damage their fins or slime coat like hard gravel alternatives.</p> <h2>Enrichment Activity</h2> <p>The&nbsp;PURE Betta Beads&trade; are lightweight enough so your betta can swim through it.&nbsp; Bettas will often burrow through the substrate and rest on the bottom.&nbsp; This is because bettas can &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the substrate around them like a cozy blanket with their electro-sensory systems.&nbsp; Although we can see the Betta, they feel they are hidden.&nbsp; The translucent substrate also reveals food that has sunk to the bottom that would be hidden by marbles or gravel.&nbsp; The bettas can push through the beads to find these hidden snacks; it looks as if they are jumping into their own little ball pit!&nbsp; Watching a betta push the beads around with their head and fins can be just as amusing entertainment for their humans.&nbsp; This behavior is reminiscent of how a betta would push through leaf litter and silt looking for food as they would in the wild.&nbsp; To a human, it looks like they are playing with the beads which is providing entertainment and preventing boredom.</p> <p><img alt="Aqueon Betta Beads" src="-/media/B45EF1B7199042ABA5B87AFECE7BB578.ashx?h=auto" style="max-width:50%; height: auto;" /></p> <p>In addition to the enriching activity, each package of Aqueon PURE Betta Beads&trade; is especially hydrated with beneficial bacteria that help break down fish waste and keep the water healthy for your betta.&nbsp; This provides an invisible layer of biological filtration for the aquarium.&nbsp; Over time, the bacteria will consume the gel material and the beads will shrink.&nbsp; Beads may also shrink more quickly if they are put into water with a high hardness or TDS level.&nbsp; If premature shrinking of the beads occurs, it is a quick indicator that the water is not optimal for your Betta. We recommend you use soft water such as deionized or many brands (but not all) of special &ldquo;Betta Waters&rdquo; available at your local pet store.&nbsp; &nbsp;To keep the beneficial bacteria active and your aquarium clean and clear, Aqueon recommends replacing the beads with a fresh pack once a month.</p> <p> Aqueon PURE Betta Beads&trade; come in a variety of colors to help you create a new and fun home for your betta and are available at your local pet retailer. Mix and match colors for a fun visual in your aquarium!</p>
