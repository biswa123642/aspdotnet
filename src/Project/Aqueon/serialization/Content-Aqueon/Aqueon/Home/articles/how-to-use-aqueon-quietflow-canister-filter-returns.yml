To a certain extent, which one you use boils down to personal preference, but there are certain applications where one is preferred over the others. Let's look at the different return systems and identify the types of aquariums each one is best suited for.&nbsp;</span></p> <h3>Water Polishing Unit</h3> <p><img alt="Aqueon Quietflow Canister 02 Filtration" src="-/media/64AA18796D4A475B83E87D9366054176.ashx?h=500&amp;w=500" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;" /></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water Polishing Unit Installation</span></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Aqueon Quietflow Canister 04 Filtration" src="-/media/106A7C31FB824F8BA533F312B9CC9AB3.ashx?h=500&amp;w=500" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;" /></span></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water Polishing Unit With Cartridge</span></p> <p>The Water Polishing Unit hangs on the back of the aquarium and is the last stage filtered water passes through before re-entering your aquarium. Fine debris and particulate matter are trapped on the filter cartridge, and dissolved impurities are removed by carbon inside it. Some biological filtration is also performed by bacteria that colonize the purpose-designed filter cartridge holder. The Model 400 features dual Water Polishing Units, which can be installed at opposite ends of larger aquariums for optimal filtration and even circulation throughout the tank!</p> <p>The Water Polishing Unit reduces the frequency of having to open the main canister to clean or replace mechanical filter media; simply pull the cartridge out and pop a new one in! Filtered water is returned quietly at the surface, enhancing surface agitation and oxygenation. The Water Polishing Unit is perfect for standard freshwater&nbsp; community tanks housing fish such as <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=00ab8d08383b4f2bbcc5a138389dbd39&amp;_z=z">tetras</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4facaafda9c8466c9a2fe708deef7e16&amp;_z=z">barbs</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=cd16ef560c5645d99e86b02c4f975f82&amp;_z=z">rasboras</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6db0159f477e4e8d9e8a6c89c6fbb5b9&amp;_z=z">danios</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5d447ba4e6ad42bfaa9765040eb30dfe&amp;_z=z">gouramis</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=c785f019b8e4420f9244b91ae80b7ba2&amp;_z=z">livebearers</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=f00cb0471ab44ccdbb5ba0f2dcb0d974&amp;_z=z">rainbowfish</a>, as well as a variety of other types of aquariums.</span></p> <h3>Water Director</h3> <p>The Water Director delivers a strong, concentrated flow of filteredwater back into the aquarium, just below the surface. The deflector is angled slightly upward to create efficient surface agitation and enhance oxygenation. It can be rotated laterally 180&deg; to direct water in any direction.&nbsp; </p> <p> Use the Water Director to create a robust current where good water circulation is needed, or to simulate fast flowing streams for hillstream&nbsp; loaches, freshwater gobies, certain plecostomus species or even giant danios!&nbsp; The Water Director is also a good choice for aquariums housing large cichlids,&nbsp; <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=41fd282cae3d4a968b40f7aede30f133&amp;_z=z"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">goldfish</span></a><span> or </span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0d1ba8cc5dca4fb7879fb611fd6b05d8&amp;_z=z"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">piranhas</span></a><span>, that generate a lot of waste, because it helps stir up organic debris and direct it into the filter.&nbsp; </span></p> <h3>Spray Bar</h3> <p>The Spray Bar return provides gentle circulation over a wide area.&nbsp; Water flow can be directed upward for good surface agitation or downward for water movement in lower areas of the aquarium. The Spray Bar comes in sections, allowing you to alternate sections for even circulation throughout your tank!</p> <p>Planted aquariums or those with less active fish like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=92fc86e7b92649a188b9001149096b27&amp;_z=z"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">discus</span></a><span>, </span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8e21d75f5c0247f2a7591f3406f74ad8&amp;_z=z"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">angelfish</span></a><span> or small schooling fish such as cardinal tetras and celestial rasboras, are perfect for this return system. The Spray Bar can also be shortened and mounted on a side panel to direct down the length of the aquarium, simulating a moderate to slow moving river or stream.</span></p> <p><span>Aqueon QuietFlow Canister Filters come complete with mechanical, chemical and biological media, hoses, connections and a choice of three water returns designed to accommodate virtually any style of aquarium. Try them all, then choose the one you and your fish like best!</span></p> <h4>Please <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=35DB89B885B942CB8A77C7A4F3B81907&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">join our newsletter</a></span>, connect with us on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/AqueonProducts/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C67A47E0AE2A4A7EB5DA000EF0FA7982&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">contact us</a></span> for more information.</h4>
