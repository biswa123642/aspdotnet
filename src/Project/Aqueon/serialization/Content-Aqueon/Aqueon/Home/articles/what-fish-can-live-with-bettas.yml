        <br /><p>The fanciful flowing fins of a male betta make them a popular pet. So, can your new fish have a friend? And if so, what fish can live with bettas? We're so glad you asked! Yes, this colorful freshwater Asian fish can indeed have a few types of aquarium mates, but they must be docile, non-aggressive fish. Here's what you need to know about combining fish species in an aquarium set up for a betta.</p> <h2>3 Species of Fish That Live Happily With Bettas</h2> <p>A betta's best friend is laid-back. Fish that tend to nip at others, especially those with long fins, are a no-go here. The best tank mates to consider introducing to a male betta include:</p> <ul>     <li><strong>Catfish</strong>: The Corydoras catfish is a chill bottom feeder that is native to small streams and rivers. In addition to sinking shrimp pellets and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B90693215206471BA9E5AA8DB95990BE&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">algae rounds</a>, a 'cory cat' will gladly gobble up leftover betta food once it settles on the bottom of the tank. Corydoras like to live in groups, so plan to get five or more of these friends for your betta.</li>     <li><strong>Tetras</strong>: These calm little fish come in a variety of colors -- from lemon and neon to glowlights -- and would make great companions for a betta. Plan to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9ADA066ADDD44ACF89A0DF04AC3595B6&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">add a school</a>&nbsp;of six or more torpedo shaped (less diamond shaped) tetras to your betta's tank to keep stress levels low, otherwise, they may turn into little nippers.</li>     <li><strong>Rasboras</strong>: Peaceful <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CD16EF560C5645D99E86B02C4F975F82&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">rasboras</a>&nbsp;are also colorful fish related to goldfish, barbs, and danios. They tend to stay small (less than 2-4 inches in length) and prefer swimming in groups of seven or more. Rasboras can</li> </ul> <p>also be housed with dwarf freshwater shrimp, another fun tankmate for your betta! </p> <p>If you don't mind thinking outside the box, you can also add a few living items to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bettafish.org/betta-fish-tank-mates/" target="_blank">your betta's tank</a> that aren't fish, such as mystery snails and live aquatic plants.</p> <p><img alt="Aqueon What Fish Can Live With Bettas? Blog Post" src="-/media/537FA8A939B64D9F82D74B476717EA22.ashx" width="500" height="323" /></p> <h2>Betta Fish Care: Can Two Betta Fish Live Together?</h2> <p>This is a popular question among new fish owners and the answer is... sometimes! You can house a female betta with a male betta to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://japanesefightingfish.org/breeding-betta-fish/?nowprocket=1" target="_blank">encourage breeding.</a> However, the female will need to visit the male's tank just long enough (12 to 24 hours) to release eggs into the bubble nest that the male will oversee until the fry hatch. </p> <p>Never attempt to put two male bettas into the same tank. This is how this popular species earned the nickname 'Siamese fighting fish'. They will indeed duel for ownership of the tank until just one fish remains. </p> <p>Love female bettas? They can live together in a small school known as a 'sorority' and mix well with the docile fish listed earlier.</p> <h3>Choosing The Best Aquarium for a Betta</h3> <p>The size of the aquarium depends on how many fish you want to house. If you're opting for a solo male betta to rule his castle, an aquarium of 1- 5 gallons is perfect. Of course, you can always go with a larger 10-gallon setup and add extra decor, such as plastic plants, whimsical accessories, and rock features. </p> <p>If your betta will share space with other fish, snails, or growing plants, size up. The rule of thumb is to allow one gallon per inch of adult-size fish. As you plan out your betta's tank mates, do the math so you get a large enough home to last them into adulthood. </p> <p>For example, if you house one male betta (approximately 3-inches fullgrown) with a school of eight rasboras that average 3-inches when full grown (that's 24-inches of adult fish), you'll need <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=205344DBB1E448C5A228E60478FE33D7&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">an aquarium that's 27- gallons or larger</a>. </p> <p>Learn more about the beautiful betta in this <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9EF8C03C70144012A77809C6D0F6B355&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">care guide</a>. We share tips on aquarium water maintenance, housing choices, what fish can live&nbsp;with bettas, feeding details, and breeding tips.</p>
