        <br /><p>Aquariums are beautiful to look at and can be a focal point in any room, but they provide so many additional benefits to everyday life that it's hard to imagine a reason not to have one. In our busy, chaotic lives we all need ways to relax, re-focus and recharge our batteries. For kids, they can be educational and teach responsibility, and studies show that viewing an aquarium can be therapeutic as it lowers blood pressure, reduces stress and has a calming effect on people.</p> <p>An aquarium makes a great focal point and gathering place in the home and provides a fun activity for the whole family. Aquariums teach kids about nature and caring for one helps them learn responsibility. Placing one in a child's bedroom can help them fall asleep at night. Viewing an aquarium is also a great alternative to playing video games or watching TV. And if you rent, most landlords that don't allow dogs or cats will be fine with an aquarium.</p> <p>In the office or workplace, an aquarium can boost morale, which in turn has a positive effect on productivity. And if you're the owner of a restaurant or tavern, a stunning aquatic setup with plants and colorful fish will make your establishment the talk of the town, bringing patrons in from far and wide. Even banks, department stores, movie theaters and libraries feature aquariums in their establishments.</p> <p><img alt="lifestyle image of aquarium on stand inside of a living room in between a mantel and television" src="-/media/D927169D0E5C46EF92870668A51B1536.ashx?h=333&amp;w=500" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></p> <p>Many teachers use aquariums in the classroom to help teach biology, water chemistry, physics, mathematics, geography, animal behavior and so much more. In the process, students also learn to work together, keep records and interact socially. Kids who learn about the world around them are more aware, more confident and more likely to succeed in life.</p> <p>Physicians, dentists and health care providers, especially those engaged in pediatrics, use aquariums to help patients relax while they wait or during treatment. Many veterinary clinics have aquariums in their waiting areas as well, for the same reason.</p> <p>In short, aquariums enhance our lives in so many wonderful ways, you have to ask yourself who wouldn't want one?</p> <p>Please <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=35DB89B885B942CB8A77C7A4F3B81907&amp;_z=z">join our newsletter</a>, connect with us on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/AqueonProducts/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C67A47E0AE2A4A7EB5DA000EF0FA7982&amp;_z=z">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
