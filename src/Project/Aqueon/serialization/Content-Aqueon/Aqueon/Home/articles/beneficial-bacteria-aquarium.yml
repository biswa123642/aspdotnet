      Hint: Content
      Value: "<br /><h1>What Are Beneficial Bacteria?</h1> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A healthy, balanced aquarium relies on beneficial bacteria to break down fish waste, dead plant material and other organic debris that accumulate in the tank.&nbsp; They keep the water crystal clear and prevent toxic ammonia and nitrite from accumulating.&nbsp; These bacteria live in the filter media and on solid surfaces in the aquarium, such as gravel, rocks, plants and decorations, but it takes time to get them established.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <h2>Why Are Beneficial Bacteria Important?</h2> Newly set up aquariums sometimes experience dangerous spikes in ammonia and nitrite from fish waste due to a lack of these bacteria.&nbsp; This happens when more fish or food are added than the existing bacteria can process.&nbsp; Ammonia is released by fish as waste and is broken down by beneficial &ldquo;nitrifying&rdquo; bacteria to nitrite and then nitrate, in what is known as the Nitrogen Cycle.&nbsp; Both ammonia and nitrite are highly toxic to fish.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to add fish gradually to new aquariums and feed sparingly at first to give beneficial bacteria time to colonize the tank and filter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> In established aquariums, accumulation of solid fish waste, uneaten food, dead plant material and other organic debris can cause a deterioration in water quality and a drop in pH.&nbsp; This is especially true in tanks containing goldfish, large cichlids, piranhas and other predatory fish.&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3>How Does Aqueon&reg; PURE Help?</h3> <p>Aqueon&reg; PURE offers a safe, convenient way to introduce live beneficial bacteria to get new aquariums started.&nbsp; In mature tanks it supplements these bacteria and adds enzymes to help break down organic sludge and aid in maintaining crystal clear water.&nbsp; Unlike many bacteria supplements that require measuring and may take time to work, Aqueon&reg; PURE spheres are pre-measured, ready-to-use, and cannot be overdosed.&nbsp; Blister packaging has a place for marking dosing dates on the inside flap to aid as a friendly reminder of last application.<br /> <br /> <em>PURE is not a replacement for regular water changes and filter maintenance but it is an effective part of a sound weekly maintenance program for freshwater aquariums.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Things to Know About Aqueon&reg; PURE:</em></p> <ol>     <li>Contains Live Beneficial Bacteria and Enzymes</li>     <li>Helps safely start up new aquariums</li>     <li>Reduces Ammonia and Nitrite in new aquariums</li>     <li>Helps maintain crystal clear water</li>     <li>Helps reduce sludge build-up in older aquariums</li>     <li>Safe to use in all Freshwater aquariums</li>     <li>Cannot be overdosed</li>     <li>Ball size varies for different sized aquariums, but potency of each sphere is consistent</li>     <li>Broken or torn balls are no less effective; broken pieces offer additional surface area for water contact with bacteria and enzymes</li>     <li>Balls do not dissolve but do shrink over time; small pieces can be siphoned out</li>     <li>Condensation inside blister-pack is normal</li>     <li>Wash hands after handling. (Blister packaging eliminates the need to handle PURE.)</li>     <li>Not for human consumption</li> </ol> <br />"
