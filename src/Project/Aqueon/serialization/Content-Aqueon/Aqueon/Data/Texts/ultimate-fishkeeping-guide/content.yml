        PART 1 - GETTING STARTED

        <p style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="choosing_the_right_aquarium">
        Choosing the Right Aquarium
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Choosing the right sized aquarium will depend on the amount of space you
        have, the kind of fish you want to keep and your budget.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        There is a natural tendency to want to start small, especially when kids are
        involved. For one thing, smaller aquariums cost less, plus it is easier to
        find a place to put them. It is natural to feel that a smaller tank will be
        easier and less complicated to take care of, but actually the opposite is
        true. Larger aquariums are more stable and more forgiving of beginner
        mistakes. When things go wrong &ndash; as sometimes happens in the beginning
        &ndash; they tend to do so quickly and often with disastrous results in a
        smaller aquarium. That does not mean you should start your youngster out
        with a 55-gallon setup (although they probably would not object to the
        idea), it just means that unless you are planning to have a Betta and
        nothing more, a 10 or 20-gallon tank
        <a href="/articles/choosing-the-right-aquarium" target="_blank">is a better choice</a>
        than a tiny desktop aquarium. Also, if your budget and available space allow
        you to go larger, bigger is always better!
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Aquarium dimension is important, too. Wider aquariums provide more surface
        area for gas exchange and more room for active fish to swim. They also offer
        territorial fish such as
        <a href="/resources/care-guides" target="_blank">cichlids </a> and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/sharks-freshwater" target="_blank">freshwater sharks</a>
        more places to set up and defend a home. Tall, narrow aquariums fit into
        tight spaces better, but they hold fewer fish per gallon and are best suited
        for less active fish such as
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/angelfish" target="_blank">angelfish</a> and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/gouramis" target="_blank">gouramis</a>.

        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="glass_vs_acrylic_aquariums">
        Glass vs Acrylic Aquariums
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Another consideration is whether to go with a
        <a href="/products/aquariums" target="_blank">glass or acrylic aquarium</a>;
        each has pros and cons. Glass tanks do not warp or scratch easily, they are
        less expensive and do not discolor over time. They are, however, more
        vulnerable to breakage. Acrylic tanks are lighter and although more
        expensive, are less vulnerable to breakage. When choosing a stand, the
        entire bottom of an acrylic or frameless glass tank must be supported, not
        just the edges as with a framed glass aquarium.

        </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Place your new aquarium where you spend the most time so you can enjoy it!
            Make sure there is an electrical outlet close by.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Avoid windows that receive direct sunlight, as this can affect water
            temperature and may contribute to excessive algae growth.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            In colder climates, avoid exterior walls and entry doors where winter
            drafts could cause a drop in water temperature.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Avoid high traffic areas where your aquarium might get bumped.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Do not place your aquarium on an uneven surface, near a fireplace or
            heating/air conditioning vent, or above electronic devices, books and
            other objects that could be damaged by water.
            </li>

        Choosing the Right Equipment
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        If this is your first aquarium, or it has been a few years since you set one
        up, boxed aquarium kits are a great way to get started as they eliminate
        having to figure out all the necessary equipment you will need, what size
        filter and heater to choose, etc. Most boxed starter kits include the tank,
        cover and light, filter, heater, thermometer, food and water conditioner
        samples, a net and setup guide, all at significant savings compared to
        buying each item separately. Aqueon offers a wide range of rectangular,
        hexagonal, bowfront and specialty aquarium kits from in sizes from 10 to 55
        gallons.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        For aquariums larger than 55 gallons, you'll need to assemble the equipment
        item by item. Here is a list of things you will need to complete your setup:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong><a href="/products/furniture" target="_blank">Stand</a></strong>
            &ndash; An aquarium filled with water, gravel and decorations weighs
            approximately 10 lbs. per gallon. Sturdy household furniture can be
            suitable for aquariums of 5 gallons and smaller, however, for anything
            larger, an aquarium stand manufactured for the size tank you are
            purchasing is your best option because they are specifically designed to
            be strong enough to support your aquarium!
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Full Hood or Glass Cover &amp; Light</strong> &ndash; A secure
            cover prevents fish from jumping out, keeps dust and foreign objects out
            of your aquarium and reduces evaporation. Fish should have a consistent
            day/night cycle and live plants need strong, high-quality light for proper
            growth. You have your choice between a
            <a href="/products/lighting/led-deluxe-full-hoods" target="_blank">full hood</a>
            or a
            <a href="/products/glass-tops/hinged-glass-tops" target="_blank">glass top</a>
            with separate light fixture.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong><a href="/products/filters-media" target="_blank">Filter</a></strong>
            &ndash; A filter is the single most important piece of equipment for a
            successful aquarium. Unlike most other animals, fish live in the same
            environment they release waste into and it is essential to your fishes'
            health that this waste be processed quickly and efficiently. You can
            choose from
            <a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-e-internal-power-filters" target="_blank">internal</a>,
            <a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-led-pro-aquarium-power-filters" target="_blank">hang-on the back</a>
            and
            <a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-canister-filters" target="_blank">canister</a>
            filters to fit a wide range of aquarium sizes. Many experienced aquarists
            will fit their aquariums with slightly oversized filters or multiple
            filters in the case of larger aquariums to help keep them clean and clear.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong><a href="/products/heating" target="_blank">Heater</a></strong>
            &ndash; Warm water and stable temperatures are essential to keeping
            tropical fish healthy and free of disease. Sudden temperature changes
            stress fish and can trigger parasite outbreaks such as ick. Choosing the
            right heater for your aquarium depends on aquarium size, desired
            temperature and the minimum temperature of the room in which the aquarium
            is located. Multiple heaters are suggested for aquariums 100 gallons or
            larger. Options include
            <a href="/products/heating/aquatic-flat-heaters" target="_blank">Flat</a>
            and
            <a href="/products/heating/mini-heater" target="_blank">Mini</a> heaters

            <a href="/products/heating/submersible-glass-heaters" target="_blank">Submersible</a>
            and
            <a href="/products/heating/pro-adjustable-aquarium-heater" target="_blank">Pro</a>
            heaters for larger aquariums. Refer to the Aqueon heater guide below for
            the right sized heater for your aquarium.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Thermometer</strong> &ndash; While many aquarium heaters have
            setting control dials, the actual water temperature may vary depending on
            water circulation and the location of the aquarium. An aquarium
            thermometer lets you know the exact water temperature. If using a stick-on
            thermometer, place it on the outside of the aquarium, above the gravel
            line, as far away from the heater as possible. Install the thermometer
            where you can easily read it and where it will not be affected by
            sunlight.

            fish and other aquatic organisms. Use Aqueon
            <a href="/products/water-care/water-conditioners" target="_blank">Water Conditioner</a>
            to neutralize these contaminants when filling an aquarium for the first

            <strong>Aerator</strong> &ndash; While an air pump is not a necessity,
            aeration does help maintain the dissolved oxygen level in your aquarium
            and aids in biological filtration. Air diffusers can be incorporated into
            decorations to enhance the aesthetics of your aquarium as well. A check
            valve should always be installed to prevent backflow when the air pump is
            unplugged or in the event of a power outage. Aqueon QuietFlow
            <a href="/products/pumps/quietflow-air-pumps" target="_blank">Air Pumps</a>
            are available in 5 sizes and feature built-in check valves.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Substrate</strong> &ndash; In addition to enhancing the aesthetics
            of your aquarium, a substrate gives beneficial bacteria a place to live.
            These micro-organisms help filter the water and provide biological balance
            to the aquarium. Use fine gravel for planted aquariums, medium grade in
            most community aquariums and coarse gravel for fish that dig a lot, like
            large
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/goldfish" target="_blank">goldfish</a> and
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/cichlids-new-world" target="_blank">cichlids</a>. Darker gravel accents the colors of your fish and conceals dirt better
            than lighter colored gravel. Rinse all gravel in plain water before
            placing in your aquarium.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Decorations</strong> &ndash; Fish need structure to feel safe and
            secure, and to avoid being harassed by aggressive tank mates. Live or
            artificial plants, rockwork, driftwood and statuary (castles, sunken
            ships, figures) serve this purpose and give you an opportunity to
            personalize your aquarium and turn it into living art. Place taller plants
            and d&eacute;cor items near the back of the aquarium to provide backdrop
            and hide filter tubes, heaters and cords, with progressively shorter
            decorations towards the front.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Background Material</strong> &ndash; In addition to providing
            visual depth and enhancing the overall look of an aquarium, a background
            also hides cords, hoses and other equipment. Background material should be
            installed on the outside of the aquarium before placing the aquarium on
            the stand and filling it with water.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Test Kits</strong> &ndash; A test kit is recommended especially
            when starting a new aquarium. Toxic ammonia and nitrite levels can rise
            quickly in new aquariums and knowing your water parameters will help avoid
            problems and keep your fish happy and healthy!

        Filtration
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Fish release waste into the same environment they eat, breathe and live in,
        making an efficient filtration system critical to their long-term health and
        well-being. Choosing the best filter for your aquarium will depend on
        aquarium size, the types of fish you keep, your feeding habits, maintenance
        practices and to some extent your personal preferences.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Most filters on the market are rated for specific aquarium sizes, however,
        the bio-load in your aquarium is just as important if not more so. Simply
        stated, this refers to the number and size of fish and the amount of food
        being fed each day. For example, a 55-gallon aquarium with one or two large
        predatory fish may require a larger filter than the same sized aquarium with
        dozens of small schooling fish because predatory fish produce larger amounts
        of waste. Fish that are fed three times a day create more waste &ndash; or a
        higher bio-load &ndash; than fish that are fed once a day. For best
        performance, always choose a filter rated for a slightly larger aquarium
        than you have. For aquariums 100 gallons or larger, multiple filters may be
        required due to the long length of these size aquariums.
        </p>
        <h4 style="z-index: 1;">Stages of Filtration</h4>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        There are three stages of filtration: mechanical, chemical and biological.
        Most aquarium filters perform all three but are sometimes better at one or
        two at the expense of the others.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanical</span>: The removal of
        solid waste, organic debris and other particulate matter by trapping it on
        fibrous or sponge material and then rinsing or replacing the media. This is
        typically the first stage of filtration, although ultra-fine media for
        &ldquo;water polishing&rdquo; is often placed at or near the end of the flow
        path in canister filters. The density of the material will determine what
        size particles are filtered out and the resulting water clarity. Finer media
        provides clearer water, but usually needs to be cleaned or replaced more
        often.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chemical</span>: The adsorption of
        dissolved pollutants using granular materials such as carbon, ion exchange
        resins, zeolite and other media. Carbon also removes the yellow or greenish
        tint common in mature aquariums. Specially treated pads that can be cut to
        size are also available and provide both mechanical and chemical filtration.
        Chemical filtration is typically the second or third stage in the filtration
        process but can vary depending on personal preferences and philosophies.
        This media must be replaced when exhausted or saturated.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Biological</span>: The conversion
        of toxic ammonia to nitrite, and then nitrite to nitrate through oxidation
        by nitrifying bacteria, often known as the Nitrogen Cycle or Biological
        Filtration. These bacteria grow on permanent media intended as the
        &ldquo;home&rdquo; for beneficial bacteria to live on. This media is not
        intended to be changed or replaced. Biological media can be composed of
        ceramic, sintered glass, plastics or even sponge. The best bio-media have
        very high surface area for maximum bacterial growth. Biological Filter media
        is generally the last stage of filtration allowing the beneficial bacteria
        to have the cleanest water possible.

                    Also known as hang-on-back (HOB) or simply hang-on filters, these
                    are the most popular filters for small to mid-size freshwater
                    aquariums because of their reliable performance and convenient
                    maintenance. As their name suggests, they hang on the back of the
                    aquarium and water is drawn or pushed into the filter chamber where
                    it passes first through a replaceable carbon filled fiber cartridge
                    and then some type of permanent biological media before returning to
                    the aquarium. The discharged water agitates the surface, thus
                    oxygenating the water and provides circulation within the aquarium.
                    Some HOB filters can be manually loaded with individual media for
                    more specialized use. Cartridges should be rinsed as needed and
                    changed monthly. Most hang-on filters must be primed by filling them
                    with water before plugging them in, however,&nbsp;<a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-led-pro-aquarium-power-filters" target="_blank">Aqueon&reg; QuietFlow LED PRO</a>&nbsp;and the Coralife&reg; Marine Filter with Protein Skimmer are

                    Compared to HOB&rsquo;s, canister filters hold more media and offer
                    the aquarist unlimited flexibility in terms of media options. They
                    are typically used on mid-size to larger aquariums in both
                    freshwater and saltwater applications. Canister filters are
                    positioned below the aquarium, usually inside the cabinet stand.
                    Water is drawn into the filter through an intake tube, passes
                    through the media and is then pumped back to the aquarium via a
                    return tube. A spray bar or directional jet is used to agitate the
                    surface and provide current in the aquarium. Canister filters
                    function best as mechanical filters and are ideal for large
                    aquariums, those with fish that create a lot of waste or fish that
                    like strong current.&nbsp;<a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-canister-filters" target="_blank">Aqueon&reg; QuietFlow&reg; Canister Filters</a>&nbsp;come in 3 sizes and feature a unique water return option, the

                    suction cups or hang on the rim using clips. Water is filtered
                    through a standard HOB filter cartridge. Closed style internal
                    filters pass water through mechanical, chemical and biological media

                    These filters were initially developed for the marine hobby, but can
                    be used in freshwater systems, as well. Placed below the aquarium,
                    water is gravity fed from the aquarium down to mechanical filtration
                    medias, such as a fiber sock or other filter pad material and into
                    the first chamber of the sump. From there, water is distributed over
                    biological media where carbon dioxide is released, and the water is
                    oxygenated. Additional chambers can be used for heaters, chemical
                    filtration media, protein skimmers (used in marine aquariums only)
                    and/or other purposes, depending on the needs of the aquarium. After
                    flowing through all the chambers, water is pumped back to the
                    aquarium. There are many different variations of sump filtration
                    systems, but the basic function is the same no matter the design.

                    <p style="z-index: 1;">
                    Sponge filters are placed on the bottom of the aquarium. Using an
                    air pump, water is drawn into the sponge and ejected through an
                    exhaust tube. Some mechanical filtration occurs, however, their main
                    function is as a biological filter. Due to the high surface area in
                    the sponge, they filter fairly large volumes of water relative to
                    their physical size. While not often used in display aquariums, many
                    breeders use them in nursery tanks because they will not trap baby
                    fish and they support important micro-organisms that serve as first
                    food for newly hatched fry.

        Lighting
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Choosing the right light is one of the most important aspects of an
        aquarium. It can also be one of the most confusing, especially for beginner
        aquarists. Choosing the best light fixture for your aquarium depends on the
        needs of the animals and plants you&rsquo;ll be keeping, the size and
        dimensions of your aquarium and your budget.
        </p>
        <h4 style="z-index: 1;">Fish and Plant Needs</h4>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        One of the most important reasons to have a light on your aquarium is to
        enjoy the beauty of the fish, plants and decorations. In addition, the fish
        need to see so they can get around, find food and interact with each other.
        But there are other considerations; live plants and certain species of fish
        have specific light needs. Some fish inhabit open water in rivers, streams
        and lakes, where the light is bright most of the day. Others prefer dimmer
        habitats among fallen logs or under overhanging vegetation. The same applies
        to plants; some grow in shallow or open water, where the light is bright and
        constant throughout the day. Others are found in deeper water or in the
        shadow of taller plants or overhanging shrubs and trees. It&rsquo;s
        important to choose a light that is appropriate for the types of fish and
        plants you keep.

        <h4 style="z-index: 1;">Light Intensity and Spectrum</h4>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Not all light is created equal. Intensity refers to how strong or
        &ldquo;bright&rdquo; a light is. Spectrum is a way of describing the mixture
        of different colors &ndash; or wavelengths &ndash; a light produces. Light
        spectrum is often given a Kelvin rating or "K rating". Light sources that
        give off a yellowish or warm effect have a low Kelvin rating, while those
        that produce a crisp bluish-white or cool light have a high Kelvin rating.
        Most freshwater aquarium lights are rated between 5,500 and 8,000 Kelvin.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Intensity and spectrum are less important in aquariums or with artificial
        plants, although some lights enhance natural colors better than others. A
        light that&rsquo;s too intense may promote algae, especially in non-planted
        tanks and may make more timid fish hide in the shadows. Where live plants
        are concerned, proper intensity and spectrum can make the difference between
        success and failure. Water depth is a factor as well. Certain wavelengths,
        especially blue, penetrate deeper into water than others, and this can be
        critical to live plants. Let your local dealer know your tank&rsquo;s height
        and the types of plants you want to keep when getting advice on the best
        light fixture for your aquarium.

        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        There are several types of aquarium lights, allowing aquarists to choose one
        that best suits their needs and those of their aquarium inhabitants.
        Aqueon&reg; and Coralife&reg; offer a wide range of full hoods, strip lights
        and clip-on lights. Here are some common choices for freshwater aquariums:

                    <p style="z-index: 1;">
                    For years this has been the most common form of aquarium lighting
                    and it continues to be popular today. Affordable pricing and a
                    selection of bulbs for different applications make fluorescent
                    lights a great choice for many aquarists. Aqueon offers strip lights
                    and full hoods as well as a selection of bulbs for rectangular,
                    hexagon and bowfront aquariums. Bulbs dim over time and should be
                    replaced every 10 to 12 months.

        Rapidly becoming the most popular type of aquarium lighting, these
        energy-efficient lights offer features that are not available in other
        aquarium lights. Aqueon LED lights are available for aquariums of almost any
        size. They use far less energy than other lights, do not heat the water and
        the LEDs last several years without losing intensity. OptiBright lights
        feature higher intensity, programmable timers, output (intensity) and
        spectrum controls, nighttime moonlights, adjustable sunrise/sunset and
        moonrise/moonset timers and different color options!

        <h4 style="z-index: 1;">Day/Night Cycle</h4>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        It is important for all living things to have a regular day/night cycle for
        optimum health and well-being. In the tropics, where most aquarium fish,
        invertebrates and plants come from, there are 12 hours of light (known as
        the photoperiod) and 12 hours of darkness every day of the year. Planted
        aquariums do best with 12 hours of light, while those without live plants
        will have less algae with a photoperiod of approximately 8 to 10 hours. Use
        a timer on your aquarium light to create a consistent day/night cycle. To
        enjoy your aquarium during evening hours, place it away from windows and set
        the timer accordingly.
        </p>

        <h4 style="z-index: 1;">Algae &amp; Light</h4>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        A commonly held belief in aquarium keeping is that too much light causes
        excessive algae growth. Algae are nature&rsquo;s way of purifying water and
        are a natural part of any aquarium. The truth is that nuisance algae
        outbreaks are more often caused by nutrient build-up rather than lighting
        issues. Planted aquarium owners rarely need to clean algae even though they
        use high output lighting because nutrients are quickly utilized by the
        plants, thus starving any algae. The trick to preventing algae growth is to
        manage nutrients with regular water changes, filter media and not
        overfeeding your fish, along with providing the right amount of light.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Choosing the right light for your aquarium enhances its natural beauty and
        ensures the long-term health of your fish, plants and invertebrate life!

        Heating
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Many aquarium fish are from tropical climates which means heat is needed to
        recreate these warm waters. Some heaters produce a constant supply of heat
        and others have an internal thermostat that regulates when the heater turns
        on and off. The ability to adjust the temperature is a feature of some
        heaters but others are preset to a tropical temperature, commonly 78⁰F, for
        a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; simplicity. Selecting the proper size
        heater is important; too small and the heater cannot effectively warm the
        aquarium, too large and the temperature can fluctuate too quickly. All
        Aqueon Heaters come with a Safety Shutoff feature that will turn the heater
        off if accidentally left plugged in when removed from the water. This
        prevents the heater from overheating causing damage. See the Heater
        Selection Chart for a great comparison visual to see the differences between
        the heater families.

                    This family of heaters produces a constant supply of heat so there
                    is no need to guess what temperature to set for the aquarium. These
                    are compact in design and can easily be hidden behind decorations
                    and plants. It is important to pay attention to the aquarium size
                    recommendations for these heaters. Because of the constant heating,
                    an oversized heater can warm the water too much, stressing the
                    fish.&nbsp;<a href="/products/heating/aquatic-flat-heaters" target="_blank">These heaters</a>&nbsp;come in multiple sizes for aquariums 1 gallon to 6 gallons.

                    Having the ability to select a specific temperature for your
                    aquarium can be important for species like Discus that like warmer
                    waters.&nbsp;<a href="/products/heating/submersible-glass-heaters" target="_blank">This heater</a>&nbsp;line has a temperature adjustment knob at the top to select
                    the desired temperature and an LED light that indicates when the
                    heater is actively heating. It has a shatter resistant glass
                    construction, but more aggressive or large fish can still break the
                    glass. This is an important thing to think about when choosing a
                    heater. Be sure to attach the suction cups above the coil heating
                    elements to prevent them from overheating.

                    The high-end shatterproof construction and adjustable dial at the
                    top makes this a&nbsp;<a href="/products/heating/pro-adjustable-aquarium-heater" target="_blank">premium heater line</a>. The LED indicator light, located in the adjustment dial,
                    illuminates when the heater is actively heating. The dark design
                    makes the heater blend it behind plants and decorations. The heater
                    is fully submersible so it can be positioned vertically (with the
                    dial at the top) or horizontally in the aquarium. The stronger
                    construction is ideal for larger fish that can be tough on items in
                    the aquarium.

        on any electrical items.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Install background material by laying the aquarium face down on a carpeted
            or protected surface and attach it using tape or hook and loop strips such
            as Velcro.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Position the aquarium and stand far enough from the wall to accommodate
            filters, hoses and cords. Make sure the stand is level and does not rock
            or wobble. Use wood shims to level and stabilize the stand if necessary.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Rinse gravel with tap water using a colander, wire strainer or fish net.
            Do not use bleach, soap or use other cleaning products.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Assemble and install the filter in the aquarium. Position the outflow to
            provide circulation throughout the aquarium. Do not plug it in yet.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            If your heater has a control dial, set it to the desired temperature
            (75&deg; - 80&deg; F for tropical fish) and install it in the aquarium.
            Position it near the filter inlet or outflow or an air diffuser to ensure
            even heat distribution throughout the aquarium. Submersible heaters can be
            installed horizontally for more efficient heat distribution. Do not plug
            the heater in yet.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Install a thermometer at the opposite end of the aquarium from the heater.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Fill the aquarium about halfway with room temperature water that has been
            treated with water conditioner. Place a plate or saucer on the bottom to
            avoid stirring the gravel as the water enters.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Install artificial plants, rockwork, driftwood and other decorations at
            this time. Live plants and fish should not be added until the aquarium has
            been running for at least 48 hours.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Once you have added decorations, fill the aquarium to 1&rdquo; below the
            rim. Prime the filter (if necessary) and plug it in using a drip loop. A
            drip loop is when you allow the cord to drop below the outlet before it
            rises up to plug in.<br />
            <strong>Pro Tip:
            <a href="/products/filters-media/quietflow-led-pro-aquarium-power-filters" target="_blank">Aqueon QuietFlow hang-on filters</a>
            do not need to primed, they are self-priming; simply plug it in!</strong>
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            If using an aerator, plug it in now. Keep air diffusers and bubble wands
            away from filter intake tubes, as they may cause the filter to stop if air
            is drawn in.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">After 30 minutes, plug the heater in.</li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Place the cover and light on the aquarium and plug the light in. Place
            your aquarium light on a timer to provide a consistent day/night cycle
            which fish, live plants and other aquatic organisms need to thrive.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve just set up your aquarium! Now sit back and
        relax while you consider what kinds of fish and other living creatures to
        put in it.

        What To Expect in the First 60 Days
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Having a new fish tank is exciting stuff! In the first two months after
        setting up your new aquarium, you are likely to see it go through a lot of
        changes; most are natural, but some changes may be signs of trouble. It is
        important to know which is which. It is going to take time for your new
        environment to find balance, but by knowing what to expect in the first 60
        days, you will be able to help it along.

            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            You are going to be excited and anxious to fill your new aquarium with
            fish. Be patient! Let your aquarium &ldquo;settle&rdquo; for at least 48
            hours before buying your first fish or live plants. This will give you
            time to make sure the temperature is set correctly and to make adjustments
            to decorations, etc.

            Unless you have already decided on what fish you want to put in your new
            aquarium, check the list of suggested beginner fish below or consult your
            local aquatic expert.

            Resist the temptation to add too many fish at once! Your filter will not
            be able to process a lot of waste at first and this could cause harmful
            ammonia and nitrite to rise to unsafe levels.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Occasionally the water in a new aquarium will turn cloudy after you
            introduce the first fish. This is caused by a bacterial
            &ldquo;bloom&rdquo; and will usually clear on its own in a few days. These
            blooms are usually harmless to fish, but it is a good idea to test for
            ammonia and nitrite to make sure they remain at zero. Resist the desire to
            do a water change if ammonia and nitrite are not detected! Water changes
            typically prolong the bloom by providing them with nutrients, and large
            water exchanges can stress your fish. Adding
            <a href="/products/water-care/pure-aquarium-gel-balls" target="_blank">Aqueon PURE</a>
            can help speed up the process by adding the bacteria directly to the
            aquarium in large volumes.

            Your new fish may hide at first. They are likely stressed from being moved
            from the store and placed in a new environment. Make sure they have plenty
            of cover and hiding places to make them feel safe and secure. For
            especially shy fish, leave the aquarium light off for a few days (if you
            do not have live plants) until they start to come out and enjoy their new
            home.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Feed sparingly! A good rule of thumb is to feed only what the fish can
            consume in 2 minutes or less. Feed once daily for now, until your tank
            goes through its first cycle. Indications of overfeeding include food
            lying on the bottom after 5 minutes, cloudy water, foaming at the surface
            or an odor when you open the aquarium lid.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Test your aquarium water for ammonia and nitrite. Even if you do
            everything right, these levels may begin to rise until the nitrifying
            bacteria in your filter catch up. Use
            <a href="/products/water-care/ammonia-neutralizers" target="_blank">Aqueon Ammonia Neutralizer</a>, water changes or chemical filtration media to prevent them from
            reaching dangerous levels. If in doubt, consult your local aquatic expert
            for assistance. The team at Aqueon is also available to help should you
            have questions during the process.

            As ammonia is converted to nitrite and then nitrate, algae may begin to
            grow on the glass and other objects in the aquarium. This is normal and is
            an indication that the
            <a href="/articles/freshwater-aquarium-water-quality" target="_blank">Nitrogen Cycle</a>
            is becoming established. Remove algae from the glass using a scrub pad or
            <a href="/products/cleaning-maintenance/algae-cleaning-magnets" target="_blank">algae scraper</a>. Never use a scrubber that has been used with soap or chemicals!
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            As long as ammonia and nitrite levels are at zero, you can continue adding
            fish to the aquarium during this period. If algae has started to appear,
            introduce algae eating fish such as
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/plecostomus" target="_blank">plecostomus</a>, otocinclus, snails and other scavengers. If you do not want to add more
            fish to your aquarium, try adding Aqueon
            <a href="/products/water-care/algae-removers" target="_blank">Algae Remover</a>

            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Always test water before purchasing new fish, and only buy a few fish at a
            time. Wait at least a week between new fish additions. Consider buying a
            plant or decoration with each fish purchase to give newcomers to the
            aquarium their own place to call home.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Occasionally, fish that have become established in the aquarium will act
            aggressively towards new fish because they consider the newcomers
            intruders to their &ldquo;territory&rdquo;. This is especially true among
            cichlids. Rearranging the aquarium d&eacute;cor and adding new decorations
            will often calm this behavior by
            <a href="/articles/fish-compatibility" target="_blank">eliminating territorial boundaries</a>.

            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Perform a 25% water change after 15 days. Do not vacuum the gravel yet, as
            you may disrupt the good bacteria that are just starting to colonize your
            aquarium. Remember to treat tap water with Aqueon
            <a href="/products/water-care/water-conditioners" target="_blank">Water Conditioner</a>
            before adding it to your aquarium.<br />
            <strong>Pro Tip: There are different philosophies on how much and how often to
            change water, but 10% to 25% every 1 to 2 weeks is a good rule of thumb.
            Small, frequent water changes are best. It&rsquo;s important to build a

        The Nitrogen Cycle
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        The Nitrogen Cycle is how waste is processed in an aquarium. Fish release
        waste in the form of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), which is toxic to aquatic
        organisms. Nitrifying bacteria living in the filter, gravel bed, and on
        solid objects in the aquarium convert ammonia to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>),
        which is also toxic. Nitrite is then converted to nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>)
        by a different set of nitrifying bacteria.&nbsp; Nitrates are not toxic to
        fish per se, however, long term exposure to high levels can stress them,
        stunt their growth, damage organs and make them more susceptible to disease.
        Nitrates are used by aquatic plants, but if allowed to accumulate nitrates,
        contribute to unsightly algae growth. Additional sources of biological waste
        include uneaten food and dead plant material.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="-/media/AB595944598B4665BF2114ADE80C7063.ashx?h=500&amp;w=500" /></p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>+)</strong> &ndash; the
        primary component of fish waste. Ammonia is harmful to fish and tends to
        rise in newly established aquaria due to a lack of nitrifying bacteria,
        adding too many fish at once, overfeeding or a combination of these factors.
        It can also rise in heavily populated tanks due to generous feeding and/or
        insufficient filtration. In water, ammonia exists in two forms: free ammonia
        (NH<sub>3</sub>) and ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub>+). Aquarium water test
        kits usually measure NH3 and NH4+ combined.
        <strong><em>The only safe level of Ammonia in an aquarium is zero.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Ammonia is <em>more</em> toxic at higher temperatures and pH levels above
        7.0
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Ammonia is <em>less</em> harmful at lower temperatures and pH levels below
        7.0
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>)</strong> &ndash; nitrifying bacteria living
        in the filter and aquarium convert ammonia to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>). A
        rise in nitrite usually follows an ammonia spike. Nitrite prevents oxygen
        exchange to fishes&rsquo; bloodstream, and high levels can cause them to
        suffocate. Fish that are experiencing nitrite toxicity will often breathe
        rapidly and gasp at the surface (although there are other reasons they do
        this), and their gill filaments will turn from bright red to dull brown or
        grey in color. The only safe nitrite level is zero.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>)</strong> &ndash; nitrite is converted to
        nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) by nitrifying bacteria. While nitrate is far less
        toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms than ammonia and nitrite, it can
        stunt your fish&rsquo;s growth and long-term exposure to high levels
        stresses them and compromises their immune systems. Nitrate is also a major
        contributor to algae growth. Some tap water sources are high in nitrate, so
        it&rsquo;s a good idea to test your tap water before using it. Nitrate
        toxicity to fish varies depending on species, age and overall health, but
        levels above 50 ppm are undesirable in freshwater aquaria. Regular partial
        water changes, proper filtration, sensible stocking and feeding habits as
        well as the use of live plants will help keep nitrates in check.

        Water Chemistry
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>pH</strong> &ndash; pH is the measure of whether water is acidic (pH
        1 to 6.9), neutral (pH 7.0) or basic (pH 7.1 to 14). Most freshwater
        aquarium tropical fish do best at a pH of 6.8 to 7.6, although certain
        species may require higher or lower levels. There is a natural tendency for
        pH to gradually drop in an aging aquarium as organic waste accumulates and
        mineral buffers are depleted. Left unchecked, pH can drop low enough to
        stress our aquatic pets. To avoid this, regular partial water exchanges
        should be done to remove pollutants and replenish minerals that naturally
        buffer pH and keep it stable.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Minor changes in pH also occur between day and night, especially in
        well-planted tanks. Plants produce oxygen by day, which contributes to a
        rise in pH, and they give off carbon dioxide at night, which lowers pH.
        These fluctuations are more pronounced in tanks that have low buffering
        capacity or use supplemental CO<sub>2</sub>.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        pH is also important when cycling a new aquarium, when ammonia can build up
        due to a lack of nitrifying bacteria to process it. As mentioned above,
        ammonia is more toxic as pH rises above 7.0, and is less toxic at pH below
        7.0. When cycling a new aquarium, test pH, ammonia and nitrite regularly to
        avoid stressing your fish. Unless you are trying to breed sensitive or wild
        caught fish from environments with extremely low or high pH, it is best not
        to try to change it. Most fish will adapt as long as Nitrogen Cycle is
        established and pH is stable.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        But what if your tap water pH is unusually high or low? Or perhaps
        it&rsquo;s within range, but you want to keep or even breed wild caught fish
        that come from extreme habitats? Aquarium shops sell products that modify
        pH, but these should be avoided altogether or used with extreme care by
        experienced aquarists to avoid sudden or drastic pH shifts. Some products,
        especially liquid pH adjusters, often have only temporary effects and pH
        soon shifts back to its original value, making it necessary to keep adding
        more. The resulting pH roller coaster this creates is very stressful to
        aquatic creatures.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        If you do decide to adjust the pH in your aquarium, it is best to do it
        BEFORE introducing fish or other livestock and test regularly to make sure
        it remains stable. If you already have fish or other creatures in your
        aquarium, never make sudden or drastic changes to pH or any other water
        parameters. Below are some natural methods for adjusting pH that are longer
        lasting and more stable over time.

        How To Safely Lower pH:
        </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Use reverse osmosis (RO) or deionized (DI) water to create the desired pH
            and provide buffering. Always prepare water and test pH before adding it
            to your aquarium.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Decorate your aquarium with natural driftwood. Tannins released by
            driftwood can help lower pH, but keep in mind that it takes a fair amount
            of driftwood to have the desired effect. One or two small pieces will not
            do much, especially in a large aquarium or one with strong buffering
            capacity.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Add peat moss or peat pellets to your filter. Like driftwood, peat moss
            contains tannins that lower pH. Use a mesh media bag to keep it contained
            and use only peat products designed for aquariums. Replenish as needed to
            maintain the desired pH.
            </li>

        How To Safely Raise pH:
        </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Use reverse osmosis (RO) or deionized (DI) water to create the desired pH
            and buffering. Always prepare water and test pH before adding it to your
            aquarium.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Use crushed coral or dolomite gravel for substrate. These calcium
            carbonate-based gravels slowly dissolve over time, raising and buffering
            pH.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Decorate your aquarium with limestone or coral rock. As with driftwood for
            lowering pH, use a healthy amount of calcium carbonate rock to create the
            desired effect.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Fill a mesh media bag with crushed coral or dolomite gravel and place it
            in your filter.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Alkalinity (KH)</strong> &ndash; Alkalinity is the measure of
        carbonates and bicarbonates in water and represents the ability to resist
        changes in pH. Carbonates help stabilize pH in the aquarium and are
        replenished through regular partial water exchanges or the addition of
        buffers. Most captive-bred fish will adapt to your aquarium&rsquo;s
        alkalinity, so it is usually not necessary to adjust it. Unless you are
        keeping wild caught fish that come from extremes in pH or hardness,
        it&rsquo;s best to acclimate new fish to your tank&rsquo;s conditions.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>General Hardness (GH)</strong> &ndash; General Hardness is a measure
        of calcium, magnesium and other ions in water, sometimes referred to as
        Total Hardness. Most freshwater fish adapt to a wide range of general
        hardness, and it is best to adjust them to your local water. Unless you are
        trying to keep or breed fish from areas of the world with extremes in water
        hardness, do not try to manipulate the pH or hardness level in your aquarium
        with additives. If your tap water is excessively hard or soft, the use of
        reverse osmosis or deionized water with Aqueon Water Renewal added is a more
        natural and stable way to adjust GH.

        Our fish depend on us to create the best environment and see to their every
        need. Here are some ways we can accomplish this:
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="habitat">
        Habitat
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Most aquarium fish need structure in their environment to feel safe,
        establish territory, breed or seek refuge. In a well-decorated aquarium,
        fish tend to stay out in the open and are less stressed. Territorial and
        semi-aggressive fish tend to quarrel less when there is ample cover.
        Decorating is also one of the most rewarding aspects of owning an aquarium.
        It allows you to personalize your aquarium, exercise your creative skills
        and turn that glass box into living art!
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        When decorating your aquarium, always take the needs of your fish into
        consideration. For example, schooling fish such as
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/tetras" target="_blank">tetras</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/barbs" target="_blank">barbs</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/danio" target="_blank">danios</a> and
        rasboras enjoy swimming among
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/aquatic-plant-basics" target="_blank">plants</a>
        (live or artificial), and choosing darker colored plants helps accent their
        bright colors. Place taller plants towards the back of the aquarium to
        create a backdrop and hide heaters, cords and filter tubes, with
        progressively shorter plants towards the front. For surface-oriented fish
        like <a href="/resources/care-guides/gouramis" target="_blank">gouramis</a>,
        hatchetfish and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/livebearer" target="_blank">livebearers</a>,
        use plants that are taller than the aquarium to create overhangs. Floating
        plants such as duckweed, hornwort and <em>Salvinia</em> create the same
        effect and are easy to grow.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Fish that like to &ldquo;den&rdquo;, such as
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/sharks-freshwater" target="_blank">redtails, rainbow sharks</a>, certain types of cichlids,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/loaches" target="_blank">loaches</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/corydoras-catfish" target="_blank">catfish</a>, and certain types of
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/plecostomus" target="_blank">plecostomus</a>
        find refuge in hollow logs, caves and ornaments like sunken ships. They will
        often patrol the entrances to their lairs and ward off any fish that come
        too close. In aquariums with
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/discus" target="_blank">discus</a> or
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/angelfish" target="_blank">angelfish</a>,
        decorate with pieces of driftwood angled from the surface down to the bottom
        to simulate the fallen trees and branches in their natural environment. For
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/cichlids-african-rift-lake" target="_blank">Rift Lake cichlids</a>, use plenty of rockwork to simulate the bolder fields found in their
        natural habitat.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        When introducing new additions to an aquarium with territorial fish such as
        cichlids, it&rsquo;s a good idea to rearrange existing d&eacute;cor to
        eliminate old territorial boundaries and add one or two new decorations to
        create additional habitat for the newcomers.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="feeding">
        Feeding
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Fish in nature spend much of their day either eating or trying to avoid
        being eaten. Some fish are omnivorous, meaning they eat a mix of protein and
        vegetation of food. Others are herbivorous, feeding mostly on plant matter.
        Which leaves the carnivores, who feed on meaty foods such as insects, worms,
        crustaceans, amphibians, other fish and even small birds and mammals! Large
        predatory fish eat less frequently, while herbivores and omnivores graze
        throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Knowing what kinds of things your fish eat in nature will help you choose
        the right food for them and gives some indication of how often they need to
        be fed. Most fish do best when fed once or twice daily. All food should be
        consumed in 2 minutes or less. Large predators do not catch food every day
        in nature, and do not need to be fed every day in the aquarium. Herbivores
        and fish that forage throughout the day should be fed small quantities of
        food two to three times daily. Aqueon offers a complete line of
        <a href="/products/food" target="_blank">flake, pellet, tablet and dried whole foods</a>
        to accommodate the nutritional needs of most ornamental fish.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Fish will normally find food whether it&rsquo;s at the surface, in mid-water
        or on the bottom. However, presenting it in the way they normally feed is
        helpful, especially for new arrivals or finicky eaters. For example, feed
        bottom feeders sinking foods, and flake or floating pellets to surface and
        mid-water feeders. Sometimes more aggressive feeders may intimidate shy
        fish, preventing them from getting enough to eat. Try feeding boisterous
        fish first and once they are distracted, direct some additional food to
        sheltered areas where shy fish can eat in peace. Finally, many
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/plecostomus" target="_blank">plecostomus</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/corydoras-catfish" target="_blank">catfish</a>
        and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/knifefish" target="_blank">knifefish</a> are
        nocturnal and stay hidden until the lights go out. While some may learn to
        eat during daylight hours, many will stay hidden and may not get enough to
        eat. Feed these fish after the aquarium light is turned off at night.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="water_exchanges">
        Water Exchanges
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Regular partial water changes remove pollutants and growth inhibitors that
        accumulate over time and help stabilize pH and buffering capacity in your
        aquarium. They replenish trace elements and important minerals that are used
        by fish, invertebrates and plants, as well as the biological processes that
        maintain balance in your aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        There are different philosophies regarding water changes in an aquarium, but
        the best practice is to do small partial water changes on a regular basis.
        The most successful aquarists perform a 10% to 25% water change on their
        aquariums every week. Changing more than 50% of the water at one time is not
        recommended. This helps remove unwanted waste while also replacing stale
        water with fresh and clean. Even though it may not look dirty, the waste can
        build up over time and is chemically altering the environment your fish live
        in. This waste remains in the water and does not evaporate out so simply
        topping off the aquarium is not preforming a &ldquo;water exchange&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;water change&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>PRO Tip - Heavily stocked aquariums, those that house large messy fish or
        extremely sensitive fish, and aquariums that are fed generously will
        benefit from more frequent changes.</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        If your tap water has unusually high pH or alkalinity or is unsuitable for
        aquarium use due to high nitrates, phosphates or other problems, consider
        using a Reverse Osmosis (RO) or Deionized (DI) water. Add a trace element
        supplement to replace essential minerals and buffers that restore water to
        its natural state and promote optimum health, color and vigor in your fish
        and live plants.

        Questions When Buying A New Fish
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Buying new fish for your aquarium is exciting! Whether you&rsquo;re new to
        the hobby or a seasoned veteran looking for something interesting to add to
        your aquarium, going to the fish store is just plain fun. There are so many
        <a href="/resources/care-guides" target="_blank">fish to choose from</a> you
        might have trouble deciding what to buy, and you could find yourself wanting
        them all! But before making any livestock purchase, there are some important
        questions you should ask to make sure you&rsquo;re making the right
        decisions for yourself and the fish:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>How big will the fish get?</strong> Many of the fish you see in
            the store aren&rsquo;t fully grown. Some may only get a little bigger,
            while others may double, triple or more in size. Always make sure the fish
            you intend to buy
            <a href="/articles/dos-donts" target="_blank">will fit comfortably in your aquarium</a>
            when they reach adult size.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>What does the fish eat?</strong> While most tropical fish do just
            fine on a diet of flake, pellet or frozen foods, some species are
            specialized feeders that may require live food or customized feeding
            methods. Some fish may grow up to eat the rest of the fish in your tank,
            while others may be herbivores that will decimate a beautifully planted
            aquarium. Before purchasing any new aquarium fish, make sure you have the
            means and dedication to
            <a href="/products/food" target="_blank">properly feed it</a> and that it
            won&rsquo;t devour the rest of your aquarium&rsquo;s inhabitants or
            plants.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Is the fish species peaceful or aggressive?</strong> If you have
            peaceful fish, you don&rsquo;t want an aggressive fish that spends its day
            chasing everyone else around, stressing them. On the other hand, if you
            have rambunctious fish, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to add a shy fish that
            will be constantly harassed and running for its life. While some fish may
            not kill their tankmates outright, being chased, nipped and kept from
            feeding will eventually take its toll on the victim, resulting in
            increased susceptibility to disease or even death.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Is the fish territorial?</strong> There&rsquo;s a difference
            between being aggressive and being territorial, although some fish can be
            both. Territorial fish will often tolerate other tank inhabitants as long
            as they have enough space and structure to define their territorial
            boundaries. They may chase other fish away if they come too close, but
            they will otherwise leave them alone. Territorial fish often do not
            tolerate other members of their species, so it&rsquo;s best to just buy
            one.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Will it get along with my fish?</strong> Keep a list of the fish
            you have in your aquarium. If you&rsquo;ve forgotten or are not sure what
            kinds of fish you have, take pictures to show store staff so they can help
            you make the right choices. Just as people do, fish have personalities of
            their own and there is no guarantee that all fish will get along. Learn
            more about fish compatibility in our helpful article:

            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>Does it need special water parameters or temperature?</strong>
            While most tropical fish sold today are raised in captivity and tolerate a
            certain range of water chemistry parameters, some are still collected in
            the wild and may need a specific pH, alkalinity or temperature to thrive.
            Always research the type of fish you intend to buy or ask if they need
            special conditions.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>How many fish should I buy?</strong> Some fish are solitary and as
            adults they do not tolerate others of their own kind or closely related
            species:
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/betta" target="_blank">betta fish</a>,
            certain
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/gouramis" target="_blank">gouramis</a>,
            redtail and rainbow sharks, and many cichlids are good examples. Schooling
            fish (tetras, barbs, danios, rasboras), on the other hand, do best in
            groups of 6 or more and may hide or become stressed if kept individually
            or in smaller groups.
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/livebearer" target="_blank">Livebearing fish</a>
            (guppies, mollies, platies and swordtails) do best in a ratio of three
            females to one male as the males tend to be relentless in their efforts to
            mate.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>How long will the fish live?</strong> Small fish like
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/tetras" target="_blank">tetras</a>,
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/barbs" target="_blank">barbs</a> and
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/danio" target="_blank">danios</a> should
            live at least 5 years, if not longer, while medium sized fish such as
            angelfish and goldfish often live 10 to 15 years. Larger
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/cichlids-african-rift-lake" target="_blank">cichlids</a>, clown
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/loaches" target="_blank">loaches</a>, and
            many
            <a href="/resources/care-guides/plecostomus" target="_blank">plecostomus</a>
            and catfish species can live 20 years or more, while koi are known to live
            even longer. Plan accordingly.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>How long has the fish been in the store?</strong> Never buy a fish
            that has just arrived in the store.
            <a href="/articles/how-to-move-an-aquarium" target="_blank">Shipping stress</a>
            temporarily lowers a fish&rsquo;s resistance and increases its
            susceptibility to disease. Moving it again without giving it a few days to
            stabilize will only compound the problem. This is especially true of wild
            caught or delicate species.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>What part of the aquarium will it occupy?</strong> Many fish spend
            their time at specific levels in the water column, and it&rsquo;s
            important both visually and in terms of compatibility to have equal
            proportions of surface, mid-water and bottom dwellers. Crowding fish in
            any layer may result in conflict and stress to some of them.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            <strong>What type of habitat does it need?</strong> In nature, fish occupy
            specific habitats such as open water, plant beds, rock structure or fallen
            trees. Always research fish before you purchase them and make sure you
            have the proper habitat in your fish tank.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Asking key questions and making sure you have the right conditions for fish
        before purchasing them will ensure they live long and happy lives and result
        in many years of enjoyment with your aquarium.

        Transport and Acclimation
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Properly acclimating new fish purchases into your aquarium has a significant
        impact on their long-term health and well-being. Netting, bagging and
        transporting fish stresses them and to compound things, water quality and
        chemistry can vary between your local fish store and your aquarium.
        Precautions should be taken to ensure the transition is as stress free as
        possible. The greater the difference between store water and your aquarium,
        and the longer your fish are in transit, the more time and care you should
        exercise when acclimating them. In addition, some fish are more sensitive to
        changes and require more gradual acclimation.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Go straight home with new fish. In extremely cold or hot weather, transport
        fish in an insulated cooler or Styrofoam shipping container. Do not place
        fish in the trunk of your car. Finally, be sure to research the fish you are
        buying in advance to make sure you have the right conditions in your
        aquarium.

        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Drip Acclimation&nbsp;</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Some fish are too large to acclimate while floating in an aquarium. Other
        fish are sensitive and require a more delicate process. In these instances,
        drip application is the best method. Airline tubing and a flow regulator are
        used to control the rate at which the water goes into the bucket. Watch the

        Acclimating fish to a new home is important for both the health of the fish
        and aquarium. Turning off the lights can help reduce stress in fish while
        they adjust to the temperature of the aquarium. A floatation ring is created
        by opening the bag and rolling it towards the outside to keep the bag afloat
        during the acclimation process. Watch the video to learn more.&nbsp;

        Nutrition and Feeding
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Often times, the first questions aquarists have after setting up their tanks
        have to do with feeding. What do I feed my fish, how much should I feed
        them, and how often? In nature, what fish eat depends on whether
        they&rsquo;re herbivores (plant eaters), carnivores (meat eaters) or
        omnivores (both). How often and how much they eat depends on their dietary
        preferences, their appetite and availability of food.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Most aquarists keep a variety of species in their aquariums, so offering a
        combination of different foods is best. For example,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/livebearer" target="_blank">livebearers</a>
        are largely herbivores, while
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/tetras" target="_blank">tetras</a> are more
        carnivorous. If you keep both types of fish in your aquarium, as many
        aquarists do, alternate feedings of meat protein and plant-based foods to
        keep everyone happy and healthy. Variety is important regardless of what
        types of fish you keep, as even carnivores benefit from some plant matter in
        their diet, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        The size of the food you feed should match the size of your fishes&rsquo;
        mouths. In other words, large predatory fish will usually show no interest
        in small flake crumbles, and small fish like Neon Tetras can&rsquo;t fit
        large pellets into their mouths. Uneaten food will quickly pollute your
        aquarium.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="how_much_to_feed">
        How Much to Feed
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        It&rsquo;s always best to underfeed, especially in new aquariums, as uneaten
        food can cloud your water and cause ammonia and nitrite levels to rise. A
        general rule of thumb is to feed only what
        <a href="/videos/educational-videos/3-tips-to-succeed" target="_blank">your fish can consume in 2 to 3 minutes</a>. When in doubt, start with a tiny quantity and observe how fast your fish
        consume it. If it is completely consumed in less than 2 minutes, give them a
        little more. It won&rsquo;t take long to figure out how much food to give
        them at each feeding. Remove any food that remains after five minutes with a
        siphon hose or net.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Where Fish Feed</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Another consideration is what part of the water column your fish feed
        in.&nbsp; Some species feed at the surface, some feed in mid-water and
        others are bottom feeders.&nbsp; Most fish will learn to take food wherever
        it&rsquo;s available, but shy fish may wait until food drifts into their
        &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo;. These fish may need to be target fed, meaning
        directing food right to them. Flakes and some pellet foods typically linger
        at the surface for a minute or two before beginning a slow descent to the
        bottom, making them good choices for surface and mid-water feeders. Soaking
        dried foods or &ldquo;swishing&rdquo; them at the surface will help them
        drop faster for mid-water feeders. Most
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/corydoras-catfish" target="_blank">catfish</a>, <a href="/resources/care-guides/loaches" target="_blank">loaches</a> and
        other bottom feeders do best on
        <a href="/products/food" target="_blank">sinking tablets, wafers and pellet foods</a>. When feeding frozen foods, dispense food a little at a time using a
        turkey baster or large syringe to make sure everyone gets some. Drop a
        little food at the surface for top feeders and gently squirt some lower into
        the water column for mid-water and bottom feeders.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">How Often To Feed</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        For the most part, feeding your fish once or twice a day is sufficient. Some
        hobbyists even fast their fish one or two days a week to allow them to clear
        their digestive systems. Larger, more sedentary fish can go longer between
        meals than smaller, more active fish. Herbivores forage throughout the day,
        so they should be fed more frequently, however, only small quantities at a
        time. Small active fish like
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/danio" target="_blank">danios</a> and newly
        hatched fry have higher metabolic rates and should be fed frequently,
        especially when kept at warmer temperatures. Water temperature regulates
        fishes&rsquo; metabolisms and influences how often and how much they need to
        be fed.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">When To Feed</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        In nature, most fish feed in the early morning and at dusk. Exceptions are
        herbivores and omnivores that forage throughout the day, and nocturnal
        species. Although aquarium fish can be fed at any time of day, morning and
        evening feedings are best. They quickly learn when &ldquo;feeding
        time&rdquo; is, eagerly swimming back and forth at the surface or emerging
        from hiding places in anticipation of their next meal.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Make sure the aquarium light has been on for at least 30 minutes before the
        morning feeding and leave it on for at least 30 minutes after the evening
        feeding. Nocturnal species such as
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/knifefish" target="_blank">knifefish</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/corydoras-catfish" target="_blank">catfish</a>
        and certain
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/plecostomus" target="_blank">plecostomus</a>
        can be fed sinking foods shortly after the aquarium light is turned off at
        night.

        Signs of Overfeeding Fish
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        The term &ldquo;overfeeding&rdquo; means feeding more food than your fish
        need or want to eat in one feeding. Even hobbyists who only feed once a day
        or every other day can be guilty of overfeeding if the food is not
        completely consumed in less than 2 or 3 minutes. Here are some tell-tale
        signs of overfeeding:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Uneaten food remains in the aquarium after 5 minutes, but the fish show no
            interest in it. In extreme cases, a fuzzy or cottony white fungus may
            begin to grow on the bottom or on decorations and plants after a day or
            two.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Aquarium water is cloudy or hazy and has a foul odor to it. Foam or froth
            may be present on the surface.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Filter media becomes clogged in a matter of days after cleaning.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">
            Excessive algae growth. Even with proper filtration and water changes,
            nitrate and phosphate accumulation from heavy feeding can contribute to
            <a href="/products/water-care/algae-removers" target="_blank">excessive algae growth</a>.
            </li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">Ammonia or nitrite levels are elevated.</li>
            <li style="z-index: 1;">Chronically high nitrates or low pH.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Providing your fish with the right diet and feeding schedule will ensure
        growth, disease resistance, vibrant colors, and long, healthy lives.

        Algae Prevention and Control
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Every aquarist encounters algae growth no matter how diligent you are about
        maintaining your aquarium. While its appearance is usually not welcome,
        algae is nature&rsquo;s way of purifying water and removing pollutants, and
        it performs a valuable function in the aquarium. Some algae growth in a
        mature aquarium is normal, however, excessive algae can be a result of
        problems in water quality and maintenance habits. There are many causes for
        algae growth and just as many remedies. Understanding what causes algae
        growth is essential to preventing and controlling it.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="nutrients">
        Nutrients
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Algae are aquatic plants in their most basic form, and like all plants, they
        need water, light, and nutrients to grow. In the aquarium, the primary
        nutrients are nitrate and phosphate, which typically come from fish waste
        but can also be present in tap water. A build-up can be caused by generous
        feeding, infrequent water changes or filter maintenance, overcrowding, using
        tap water that has high nutrient levels, or a combination of one or more of
        the above. If you start to see excessive algae growth, test your aquarium
        and tap water for nitrate and phosphate. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) should be
        below 10 ppm and phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) should be below 0.5 ppm.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        To keep nitrate and phosphate levels in your aquarium low, avoid having too
        many fish, feed sparingly and perform regular water changes using nitrate
        and phosphate free water. To lower high nutrient levels and maintain optimum
        water quality, clean your filter regularly, use
        <a href="/products/filters-media/replacement-specialty-filter-pads" target="_blank">Aqueon Water Treatment Filter Pads</a>, Kent Marine Nitrogen Sponge, Phosphate Sponge, Organic Adsorption Resin,
        Power-Phos or Reef Carbon. If your tap water has high nutrient levels, use
        reverse osmosis or deionized water with
        <a href="/products/water-care/water-renewals" target="_blank">Aqueon Water Renewal</a>, R/O Right or Liquid R/O Right when doing water changes.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="excessive_light">
        Excessive Light
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Many people believe that the sole cause of nuisance algae is too much light.
        While it is certainly a contributing factor, algae are more common in
        aquariums with high nutrient levels, especially if there are no live plants.
        Avoid placing an aquarium where it will receive direct sunlight, even if
        it&rsquo;s only for a few hours a day. Limit the number of hours the
        aquarium light is on, especially if you do not keep live plants. A maximum
        of 6 to 8 hours of light is sufficient in unplanted aquariums, while planted
        aquariums should receive 12 hours of high-quality light. Use a timer to
        provide a consistent photoperiod.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Quality of light is another contributing factor to algae growth. Fluorescent
        lamps weaken and undergo a change in spectrum called &ldquo;color
        shift&rdquo; as they get older. Since algae are more tolerant of marginal
        conditions, they tend to prosper under gradually deteriorating light whereas
        many aquarium plants do not. For the best results, fluorescent light bulbs
        should be changed every 10 to 12 months.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="types_of_algae">
        Types of Algae
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Brown Algae</strong> &ndash;
        most brown algae are a form of diatom. They are often seen in newly set up
        aquariums and will usually die off on their own after the tank cycles.
        Diatoms use silicates to build their cell walls, so if your tap water
        contains high silicate levels, use reverse osmosis or deionized water when
        setting up your aquarium. Place Organic Adsorption Resin or Reef Carbon in
        your filter to remove nutrients and introduce plecostomus, otocinclus or
        nerite snails to control brown algae in established aquariums.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Green Algae</strong> &ndash;
        there are many types of green algae. Some are soft and easy to remove, while
        others are hard and can be more tenacious. They grow on the aquarium glass
        as well as decorations and even the gravel. Snails and algae eating fish
        help keep many forms of green algae in check. Maintain low nutrients and
        avoid overfeeding or overstocking your aquarium to prevent outbreaks.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Blue-green Algae</strong>
        &ndash; these appear as a heavy, dark green film or &ldquo;slime&rdquo;.
        They are actually not algae, but rather a form of cyanobacteria. Left
        unchecked, they can suffocate live plants and even cause harm to fish.
        Blue-green algae can be removed by siphoning them from the aquarium, but
        they often quickly return. Several products are available for eliminating
        blue-green algae that are safe to use in fresh or saltwater aquariums.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Filamentous Algae</strong>
        &ndash; there are many forms of filamentous algae, including hair, string,
        beard, black brush and thread algae. They are usually caused by a build-up
        of phosphate in the water and can be seen clinging to plants and other
        decorations. Longer forms can be removed by twirling them around a
        toothbrush. Siamese algae eaters, mollies, redtail and rainbow sharks,
        goldfish and Amano shrimp are known to eat them. Shorter varieties can be
        eradicated using bristlenose and clown plecostomus, otocinclus, nerite
        snails and dwarf freshwater shrimp. Plant leaves that become covered in
        filamentous algae should be trimmed out. To prevent filamentous algae
        outbreaks, feed sparingly, do frequent partial water changes using
        phosphate-free water and use Phosphate Sponge or Organic Adsorption Resin in
        your filter.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Green Water Blooms</strong>
        &ndash; these suspended algae cause the water to turn bright green and very
        cloudy. Green water blooms are usually caused by high nitrate and phosphate
        levels, along with excessive light. Many hobbyists try to solve the problem
        by doing water changes, but the effects are temporary, and the problem
        quickly returns, often with a vengeance due to the addition of nutrients
        from tap water. Blacking out the aquarium for several days by covering it
        with a blanket and turning off the light can be effective, but this is
        detrimental to live plants and may result in ammonia and nitrite spikes when
        the bloom suddenly dies off. Diatom filters and UV sterilizers are the most
        effective cure. Chemical algaecides and coagulants also work, but again,
        sudden algae die-offs can spike ammonia and nitrite levels and some
        coagulants interfere with the fishes&rsquo; gills.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="live_plants">
        Live Plants
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        You may have noticed that well-planted aquariums rarely have any algae.
        That&rsquo;s because aquatic plants remove nutrients from the water and
        starve out algae. Live plants are one of the most effective ways of
        preventing algae growth in an aquarium, but it takes more than just one or
        two to be effective. Live plants work best at preventing algae when the
        aquarium is heavily planted. Fast growing bunch plants like Hornwort,
        Wisteria and Rotala are very effective at using nutrients and keeping algae
        at bay.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="algae_eating_fish">
        Algae Eating Fish
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Sometimes, despite our best efforts, some algae growth is inevitable.
        Plecostomus, otocinclus, farlowella, Siamese algae eaters, hill stream
        loaches and some freshwater sharks feed directly on algae. Bottom feeders
        like Corydoras catfish and other loach species help reduce nutrient build-up
        in the water by cleaning up uneaten food and consuming dead plant debris and
        other organic material that accumulates on the bottom of the aquarium. Use
        caution when adding plecostomus to planted aquariums, as some species are
        known to eat broadleaf plants like Amazon swords and Anubias.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="snails">
        Snails
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Aquarists often think of snails as a nuisance, largely because of outbreaks
        of Malaysian trumpet snails (<em>Melanoides tuberculata</em>) and Ramshorn
        snails (<em>Planorbarius spp</em>). However, several types of freshwater
        snails are excellent at algae control and will not overrun the aquarium.

        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Mystery or Inca snails (<em>Pomacea spp.</em>) feed directly on algae, food
        and dead plant material that contribute to nutrient build-up. They are
        available with black or golden bodies and several shell colors. They will
        not eat live plants or overrun your aquarium. In fact, they must leave the
        water to reproduce, often depositing egg clusters on the underside of the
        aquarium lid. Due to their size, mystery snails are best kept in medium to
        large size aquariums.

        Nerite snails (<em>Neritina spp.</em>) have gained in popularity due to
        their appetite for algae and beautiful shell patterns. There are many types,
        including some saltwater species, but Tiger and Zebra Nerites are the most
        stunning and best suited for freshwater aquariums. A secure cover is
        required as these snails are known to climb out of the aquarium. They are
        ideal for aquariums 20 gallons or smaller, although they can be placed in
        any size aquarium.

        Rabbit snails (<em>Tylomenia spp.</em>) are a recent addition to the
        aquarium trade from Sulawesi, Indonesia, that are rapidly gaining in
        popularity due to their active nature, interesting appearance and bright
        colors. They do best on a sand substrate and prefer temperatures between
        80&reg; and 84&reg; F and a pH above 7.5. As with all aquatic snails, a
        calcium supplement will help maintain healthy shells. They are voracious
        algae eaters and have very low reproductive rates, so they won&rsquo;t
        overpopulate your aquarium. They are not known to eat live plants; however,
        some anecdotal accounts suggest they may be attracted to Java Ferns.

        <em>Caridina</em> and <em>Neocaridina</em> shrimp are popular aquarium
        inhabitants that are often used to control hair and string algae, especially

        Amano shrimp (<em>Caridina multidentata</em>) can be kept in most community

        Filtration
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Diatom filters and UV sterilizers are very effective at solving green water
        blooms, but not other forms of algae. Diatom filters trap suspended algae
        cells on a layer of diatomaceous earth. The filter should be checked and
        re-charged frequently at first as it will clog quickly. UV sterilizers kill
        the algae as they pass through the light chamber, and do not require any
        cleaning. Partial water changes should be done every few days to prevent
        ammonia and nitrite build-up. Both filters should be left on the aquarium
        for 7 to 10 days to ensure all algae cells have been removed.

        Chemicals for Algae Problems
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Chemical algaecides should never be your first choice when dealing with
        algae problems, as they do not address the
        <strong><em>cause</em></strong> of most outbreaks. They can provide a
        temporary solution, but sooner or later the problem will return if the
        original cause is not addressed. Proper filter maintenance, regular water
        changes, appropriate lighting and sensible stocking and feeding practices
        are far more effective at preventing and controlling algae growth. That
        said, sometimes outbreaks occur that do not respond to natural methods of
        preventing or eradicating them. In those instances, products like
        <a href="/products/water-care/algae-removers" target="_blank">Aqueon Algae Remover</a>
        can help but they should always be used as a last resort. Always follow
        product directions and remove carbon and other chemical media from your

        Fish Compatibility
        </h2>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Choosing fish that get along is a challenge every aquarist faces. While
        there are certain combinations we know with relative certainty do or do not
        work in most instances, there are countless others that can go either way
        depending on a variety of factors. Here are some things to keep in mind when
        purchasing fish for your aquarium that can help determine fish
        compatibility.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50vh; margin-top: -50vh; z-index: 1;" id="aquarium_size">
        Aquarium Size
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Most fish need space, and the more they have the better they tend to get
        along. When fish are crowded they become more agitated and are more likely
        to quarrel with tank mates. A general
        <a href="/articles/how-to-help-keep-your-pet-fish-alive">rule of thumb</a>
        for stocking a fish tank is one inch of adult size fish per net gallon of
        aquarium capacity, but territorial fish need even more space. Remember that
        the fish you buy will probably grow, and a 30 gallon aquarium doesn&rsquo;t
        actually hold 30 gallons of water when you factor in internal dimensions,
        gravel and decorations. Also, what to us is a large aquarium (200+ gallons),
        is still just a fraction of the space fish have in their natural habitats.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="-/media/60ACA43D40984F49BE4D842FDDE65D28.ashx" /></p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Aquarium Dimension</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Another consideration is the
        <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aqueon.com/-/media/Files/AqueonNew%20NA/US/CriticalDimensions.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=18646B8A917D8ED24FEEAB1C5A8DF19712605FA1" target="_blank">dimensions</a>
        of your new aquarium. Different fish prefer different shapes and swimming
        spaces. Wider aquariums give active fish, like danios and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/barbs" target="_blank">barbs</a>, the space
        to spread out, which in turn helps them get along better. On the other hand,
        tall, narrow aquariums are appealing to look at and fit into narrow spaces
        but don&rsquo;t offer fish as much swimming space or territory as a wider
        aquarium. These aquariums should be used for less active fish like discus,
        angelfish and gouramis.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Decorations and Plants</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Aquarium decorations help with fish compatibility in several ways. Most fish
        need a place to call their own and they define their personal areas by
        physical boundaries. In addition, when they can&rsquo;t see each other, they
        tend to mind their own business. Rocks, caves, driftwood and other
        decorations help define territories for cichlids and other territorial fish,
        while tall bushy plants provide habitat and give schooling fish like
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/tetras" target="_blank">tetras</a>,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/barbs" target="_blank">barbs</a>, danios and
        rasboras their own areas to occupy. When introducing
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/cichlids-new-world" target="_blank">new cichlids</a>
        to existing populations, add a few new rocks or other decorations and
        rearrange existing d&eacute;cor to eliminate territories controlled by
        established fish.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; z-index: 1;">

        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Fish communicate in a variety of ways, but sometimes their signals can be
        misinterpreted because fish from different parts of the world &ldquo;speak
        different languages&rdquo;.
        <a href="/resources/care-guides" target="_blank">Research fish</a> before
        buying and try to stock your aquarium with fish from the same region,
        especially if they are aggressive or territorial species.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Cichlids, certain species of sharks, loaches, knife fish, mormyrids and
        other territorial fish do not share space well with members of their own
        kind or closely related species. Large aquariums with
        <a href="/articles/how-to-help-keep-your-pet-fish-alive" target="_blank">plenty of cover help</a>, but many of these fish are best kept individually and tank mates should
        not be similar looking or closely related.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Asking your local retailer about how to build a community fish tank,
        featuring a variety of species is always a good option. Finding an
        appropriate fish compatible with bettas, for example, can be challenging but
        your local expert can help advise you as needed.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Fish Age</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Juvenile fish are usually easy going, even if they are known to become
        aggressive as adults. They can often be mixed with a wider selection of tank
        mates, which they&rsquo;ll accept as they grow and mature. There are many
        reports of Oscars and other large predatory fish coexisting with feeder
        goldfish that they could easily swallow, but don&rsquo;t, because both fish
        were purchased when they were the same size, before the predator grew larger
        and learned to eat other fish.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Fish Size</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        An old aquarium adage states &ldquo;if a fish can fit into another
        fish&rsquo;s mouth, chances are it will end up there.&rdquo; Most fish are
        opportunistic when it comes to food, and even relatively peaceful fish will
        try to eat other fish if they think they can. Always
        <a href="/articles/how-to-help-keep-your-pet-fish-alive" target="_blank">purchase fish</a>
        that are roughly the same size as those in your aquarium. When mixing
        territorial fish, newcomers should be at least the same size as the largest
        or most aggressive fish already in the tank.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Fish Gender</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Male fish tend to be more territorial and aggressive, particularly when
        mating. This is especially true for cichlids. Avoid having more than one
        male of the same or closely related cichlid species or other territorial
        species, especially if females are present. Keep
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/livebearer" target="_blank">livebearers</a>
        in ratios of 2 to 3 females per male to diffuse the persistent mating
        behavior of males.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Number of Fish</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Boisterous fish like tiger
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/barbs" target="_blank">barbs</a> and even
        certain species of
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/tetras" target="_blank">tetras</a> and
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/danio" target="_blank">danios</a> are often
        better behaved when in large schools. Shy schooling fish are less likely to
        be picked on when kept in larger numbers as well. Always buy schooling fish
        in groups of 6 or more. While most fish get along better when they have more
        space,
        <a href="/resources/care-guides/cichlids-african-rift-lake" target="_blank">African Rift Lake Cichlids</a>
        do best when crowded a little as this deters dominant fish from singling out
        weaker or submissive fish.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Territory &amp; Dominance Hierarchies</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        These are especially common in cichlid communities, where distinct pecking
        orders exist. Smaller or submissive fish that are harassed may need to be
        removed. Removing the aggressor is another option, however, the next fish on
        the totem pole may quickly assume the dominant role, continuing the cycle.
        When
        <a href="/articles/how-to-help-keep-your-pet-fish-alive" target="_blank">adding new fish</a>, make sure the aquarium is large enough and has enough cover to
        accommodate newcomers. Always purchase fish that are at least as large as
        the biggest or most aggressive fish in your aquarium.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Predatory Fish</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        We often think of predatory fish as large, aggressive creatures, typically
        in the Family Cichlidae. But there are other types of predators, such as
        catfish, halfbeaks, leaf fish, needlefish, bichirs, certain gobies,
        arowanas, stingrays and gar, to name just a few. For these fish, whatever
        they think they can fit in their mouth is fair game. It doesn&rsquo;t make
        them mean or aggressive, it just means they&rsquo;re hungry and following
        the law of nature. Many catfish species are nocturnal and come out at night
        to hunt small fish resting on the bottom.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Fish That Are Breeding</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        All fish that practice parental care &ndash; mostly, but not restricted to,
        cichlids &ndash; become especially defensive at breeding time. They will
        take over and control large areas of the aquarium, pushing all other
        inhabitants into a far corner. Anyone who has had a normally peaceful pair
        of angelfish spawn in their aquarium can attest to this. Be prepared to move
        &ldquo;prospective parents&rdquo; to a dedicated breeding tank.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Fish Personalities</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        While we can generalize about the typical behavior patterns of a given
        species, there are always exceptions to the rule. All of the factors
        mentioned above can affect how fish interact in an aquarium, but at the end
        of the day,
        <a href="/articles/do-fish-have-personalities" target="_blank">fish have individual personalities</a>
        and sometimes they behave in uncharacteristic ways. The best approach is to
        expect the unexpected and be prepared to separate fish that do not get
        along.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Always do plenty of research before buying new fish for your aquarium and
        leave yourself options for relocating fish that don&rsquo;t work out,
        especially in those &ldquo;iffy&rdquo; situations.

        Disease Prevention
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Virtually all fish diseases can be traced to stress, which weakens their
        immune systems. Sources of stress include shipping, poor water quality,
        improper water chemistry, inadequate
        <a href="/products/filters-media" target="_blank">filtration</a>, improper
        diet, overcrowding, leaving the light on 24/7, aggression from other fish,
        physical injury and inadequate habitat. To keep your fish in optimum health,
        perform regular partial water exchanges, be diligent about filter
        maintenance, feed your fish a varied and high-quality diet, don&rsquo;t
        overstock your aquarium, put the light on a timer to simulate a normal
        day/night cycle, remove aggressive fish, and create a habitat that closely
        resembles their native environment. When performing water exchanges, always
        treat tap water with a conditioner before adding it to your aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Never purchase fish that have just arrived at your local aquarium store. New
        arrivals are usually stressed and moving them again will only stress them
        further. They could also be carrying diseases which are not yet apparent.
        Let them settle in for a week or more before purchasing. Take new purchases
        straight home and acclimate them to your aquarium&rsquo;s pH and temperature
        for at least 30 minutes, spending extra time with sensitive species or if
        the store&rsquo;s water chemistry is significantly different from yours.
        Make sure there is plenty of cover for all your fish and rearrange
        decorations if necessary, to deter established fish from harassing new
        arrivals. After adding new fish to your aquarium, leave the light off for a
        few hours to allow them to adjust to their new environment. Do not tap on
        the glass or suddenly turn on the aquarium light in a dark room.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        While most freshwater aquarium fish are raised in captivity today, some
        rarities and oddball fish are still collected in the wild. These fish may
        have a higher chance of carrying diseases and have typically gone through
        far more stress on their way to your aquarium. Extra care and quarantine
        measures should be taken when purchasing wild caught fish. When keeping
        burrowing fish such as eels and certain types of loaches, use sand instead
        of gravel to avoid injury to their bodies when they burrow into the
        substrate.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Quarantine</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        An effective way of maintaining a disease-free aquarium is to quarantine all
        new additions. While this may not be practical for every aquarist, it is
        well worth the investment for those who keep high value fish such as discus,
        rare fish or dedicated planted aquariums where the use of medications is not
        recommended. Quarantining new fish greatly reduces the chance of introducing
        a disease organism into your aquarium and allows you to safely treat sick
        fish if necessary. A quarantine aquarium can also be used to isolate bullies
        or fish that are being picked on.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        A 20-gallon aquarium works for most situations. It should be filtered,
        heated, and maintained just like any other aquarium, and should be fully
        cycled with test fish before being used for new purchases or treatment. To
        provide cover for fish, decorate the aquarium with plastic plants or other
        non-porous decorations that are easy to sterilize and/or clean. Do not use
        porous rocks or driftwood as they can absorb medications. Different sized
        PVC fittings or sections of pipe can also be used as hiding places. Do not
        use gravel or substrate, as this gives parasites, like Ich, a place to
        reproduce.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Remove carbon and other chemical media from the filter when treating your
        fish, as they will adsorb medications, lowering their effectiveness. An
        aerator is recommended in addition to the filter, as some medications lower
        the oxygen level in the water. A light can be used but is not necessary, as
        dimmer surroundings will calm your fish and are also known to inhibit some
        pathogens.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Whenever you purchase new fish, place them in the quarantine aquarium for a
        minimum of 30 days to make sure they are not sick. Many hobbyists treat new
        purchases preventatively against parasites whether they are observed on
        their fish or not. A quarantine aquarium can also be used to isolate and
        observe fish from your main aquarium that are stressed or being picked on.
        Perform a 25% water exchange and filter with carbon for at least 48 hours
        before switching medications or introducing new fish to your quarantine
        station.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Have a separate net, siphon hose, algae scraper, and other equipment for
        your quarantine aquarium, and never use them in your display aquarium. Doing
        so risks spreading diseases and defeats the purpose of the quarantine
        aquarium. Disinfect this equipment in bleach water and rinse well on a
        regular basis. After working in your quarantine aquarium, scrub your hands
        and lower arms with an anti-bacterial soap before working in your display
        tank.

        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Ultra-violet Sterilizers</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Disease causing organisms exist in virtually every aquarium, but they will
        not infect fish if their numbers remain low and the fishes&rsquo; immune
        systems are functioning properly. Ultra-violet sterilizers kill
        disease-causing organisms as well as suspended algae and help keep water
        healthy and crystal clear. Coralife Turbo-Twist&reg; UV Sterilizers are
        available in three sizes and accommodate aquariums up to 500 gallons. UV
        sterilizer lamps should be changed every 10 months or 7,000 hours of
        operation to maintain peak performance.

        Disease Recognition
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        In order to recognize problems that may arise, it&rsquo;s helpful to have an
        understanding of what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; appearance and behavior are for
        your fish. Observe your fish regularly &ndash; feeding time is a good
        opportunity to do this. Look for white spots, cloudy eyes, bloody patches, a
        white body film or torn, ragged fins. Also, there are certain things fish
        never (or at least very rarely) do. For example, fish do not normally gasp
        at the surface. They typically do this because of poor oxygenation, high
        nitrite levels, parasites, or damage to their gills. Other behaviors that
        are cause for concern include loss of color, shimmying, rubbing against
        decorations or the substrate, cowering, refusing food, or dashing
        erratically around the aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        If your fish appear sick or exhibit abnormal behavior, talk to an aquarium
        expert as soon as possible for assistance with diagnosis and treatment.
        Photographs or a short video of your fish can be extremely helpful when
        seeking advice, as verbal descriptions can be misinterpreted by aquarium
        shop personnel and other experts.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Common Diseases:</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        You can&rsquo;t predict if or when your fish will get sick or what disease
        they might come down with, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to be familiar with
        common ailments and their symptoms so you can quickly begin treatment if you
        think they may be infected. Being able to recognize problems and begin
        treatment early gives you the best chance of saving your fish!
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Ich</strong>: &ldquo;Ich&rdquo; (Pronounced ICK) is short for
        <em>Ichthyopthirius multifiliis</em>, the most common aquarium parasite. The
        most noticeable symptom is small raised white spots on the body and fins,
        however rapid breathing, rubbing against the decorations or gravel,
        twitching, or darting around the aquarium can be early indicators of an
        infection as well. Common triggers for the onset of Ich are a sudden change
        in temperature or introducing new fish to the aquarium. Incoming fish can be
        carriers of Ich without showing signs, but your aquarium can also have a low
        population of parasites that existing fish have become resistant to. New
        fish are typically stressed and have lowered immune systems, making them
        more likely to become infected. Scaleless fish such as loaches, catfish and
        eels, and silver-scaled fish such as silver dollars, hatchet fish and bala
        sharks tend to be more susceptible, but all fish can be affected. If you
        think one of your fish might be infected, treat the entire aquarium, as Ich
        is highly contagious. The earlier you recognize it and begin treatment, the
        better your chances are of curing your fish. Click
        <a href="/articles/aquarium-disease-prevention">here</a> for recommended
        treatment methods.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Chilodonella</strong>: This protozoan parasite produces similar
        symptoms to Ich, such as labored breathing, gasping at the surface, clamped
        fins, heavy mucous secretion and scratching on objects in the aquarium. An
        outbreak of <em>Chilodonella</em> is often associated with poor water
        quality. Discus and young fish tend to be more susceptible, but it can
        infect any fish. Effective treatments include formaldehyde, methylene blue
        and acriflavine. Raising the temperature does not typically provide any
        benefit.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Oodinium</strong>: Also known as Velvet, Rust or Gold Dust disease,
        there are several species of this dinoflagellate that attack fishes&rsquo;
        skin and gills. Symptoms include a yellow to rust colored dusting on the
        fish&rsquo;s body, heavy mucous secretion, clamped fins and/or labored
        breathing or gasping for air. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are
        observed, the chances of saving the fish are limited and massive die-offs
        from this disease are not uncommon. The best treatment for
        <em>Oodinium</em> is Acriflavine. It should be noted that this product
        stains the water an electric yellowish-green that persists for a long time.
        Water exchanges and the use of carbon in your filter will eventually clear
        the water. Copper sulfate can also be effective, but remember that it is
        lethal to shrimp, snails and most live plants and is not as effective in
        soft water. Raising the temperature to 86&deg; F is also known to kill
        <em>Oodinium</em>, but this lowers the oxygen level in the water.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Fish Lice</strong>: Fish lice are crustaceans in the genus
        <em>Argulus</em>. They have a broad flat shell, four sets of swimming legs
        and are easy to see. Infected fish may swim erratically or rub up against
        objects in the aquarium to try to remove them. Upon close inspection, you
        may be able to see the lice moving around on your fish! Fish lice are
        usually brought into the aquarium on pond-raised or wild caught fish. They
        occur most often on goldfish and koi, but they can infect any freshwater
        fish. <em>Argulus</em> attach to the fish&rsquo;s body and begin digesting
        its body tissue. Severe infections are particularly damaging and can lead to
        secondary bacterial infections. Fish lice can be physically removed using
        tweezers, however, the aquarium should also be medicated to kill any eggs
        that have been laid. <strong><em>Dimilin</em></strong> is known to be
        effective against fish lice.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Anchorworm</strong>: <em>Lernea cyprinacea</em>, known as
        anchorworm, is another crustacean commonly seen on goldfish and koi, but
        they can infect any fish. They have multiple life stages, and infestation
        begins as what looks like a pimple or red sore on the fish, then later the
        string-like bodies of females can be seen attached to the fish. Anchorworms
        bore into the fish&rsquo;s body through the scales, attach using hook-like
        appendages and begin to digest body fluids. They also invade the
        fish&rsquo;s gills and mouth cavities. They can be removed using tweezers,
        but care must be taken to pull the entire parasite out, as they sometimes
        break off, leaving the head and &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; attached. When pulling
        <em>Lernea</em> out of a fish, a small chunk of flesh may be removed,
        requiring the use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections.
        To prevent further infestations, the aquarium should be treated with salt or
        <strong><em>Dimilin</em></strong> to kill eggs and other life stages.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Flukes</strong>: Fish flukes (<em>Gyrodactylus spp.</em>) are a
        group of parasites that invade the skin and gills of aquarium fish. They
        attach using a set of &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; and begin sucking blood and body
        fluids, thus weakening the fish. Symptoms include loss of color, difficulty
        breathing, excess mucus secretion, listlessness, clamped or tattered fins,
        flared gills and small blood spots on the fins and body. Like most fish
        diseases, fluke outbreaks usually result from stress caused by shipping,
        poor water quality, improper diet, overcrowding or aggression from other
        fish. They are often introduced into aquariums by new fish purchases that
        are not quarantined. The safest and most effective treatment for fish flukes
        is <strong><em>Praziquantel</em></strong>. Treating the aquarium with formalin can also be effective.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Lateral Line Disease (Head and Lateral Line Erosion or HLLE)</strong>: Also known as &ldquo;hole in the head&rdquo;, this disease is caused by
        the protozoan <em>Hexamita</em> and is commonly seen in discus, oscars,
        severums and angelfish, although it can infect any freshwater fish. Typical
        symptoms are cavities in the fish&rsquo;s temples and along the lateral
        line. Another symptom is white, stringy feces. <em>Hexamita</em> often
        starts in the fish&rsquo;s intestines and then goes systemic. Poor water
        quality is often a contributing factor for this disease. It is usually
        treated with metronidazole, also sold as <strong><em>Flagyl</em></strong>. The most effective treatment method is medicated food, but if the fish
        has stopped eating, metronidazole can be added directly to the aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Nematode Worms</strong>: Commonly referred to as roundworms,
        nematodes can be difficult to accurately diagnose, and symptoms can be
        similar to many other diseases. Common signs of a roundworm infection
        include hemorrhaging of the body, bloating of the abdomen or the opposite
        &ndash; wasting away &ndash; even though the fish is eating well, cysts or
        lumps on the body, or the actual worm protruding from the fish&rsquo;s anus.
        Another symptom is white feces, although this can also be caused by internal
        bacterial infections or Hexamita (see above). Effective treatments include
        levamisole, metronidazole or praziquantel. Metronidazole and praziquantel
        are especially effective when used as food soaks. Antibiotics such and
        nitrofurazone or erythromycin may also help prevent secondary bacterial
        infections. Read all package directions before using any medications and
        avoid mixing different medications in the aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Bacteria</strong>: Sometimes referred to as Fin and Tail Rot,
        bacterial infections are the second-most common diseases aquarium fish
        experience after parasites. They often follow parasite infestations,
        abrasions or physical injury, but can also be brought on by chronic exposure
        to poor water quality and/or poor diet. Removal of a fish&rsquo;s protective
        mucous membrane or scales during netting is another common cause.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Bacterial infections manifest in many ways, but common signs include a white
        film on the fish&rsquo;s body or fins, cloudy eyes, tattered fins, and
        hemorrhaging (bloody patches) or open sores (ulcers) on the body and mouth.
        Also, if you still see white spots on your fish after 5 or more days of Ich
        treatment, your fish may have a secondary bacterial infection where the
        parasites bored into their bodies.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Treating for bacterial infections can be tricky and should be done with
        care, as some antibiotics can disrupt your aquarium&rsquo;s biological
        filter. In addition, unless you have access to an incubator and are
        knowledgeable in fish pathology, correctly diagnosing what specific bacteria
        have infected your fish is nearly impossible. That said, some trends do
        exist, and certain medications are known to be effective in specific
        instances. Always consult an experienced aquarium professional before
        treating your fish for bacterial infections.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Fungi</strong>: True fungal infections in fish are less common than
        parasites or bacteria. They typically appear as white cottony or
        &ldquo;furry&rdquo; growths on fish but can also be internal. They can be
        induced by substandard water quality, infected food or open wounds, but
        there are many other causes. Although fungal infections are not generally
        contagious, infected fish should be treated immediately with an anti-fungal
        medication, preferably in a quarantine aquarium.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Viruses</strong>: Viruses are tiny organisms that invade the
        fish&rsquo;s cells and begin to replicate. They can be difficult to diagnose
        because they often produce similar symptoms to many other fish diseases.
        Viral infections are well documented in koi and goldfish as well as
        angelfish, but they can affect all aquarium fish. There are no known cures
        for viral infections. Fish that are suspected of having a viral infection
        should be removed from the aquarium promptly to prevent spreading to other
        fish. Treatment with antibiotics or anti-parasitic medications in a
        quarantine aquarium can be attempted in case the infection is a bacteria or
        parasite and not a virus.
        </p>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        <strong>Dropsy</strong>: Also known as &ldquo;pinecone disease&rdquo; or
        Malawi bloat, dropsy is more a set of symptoms than an actual disease. It
        can be caused by a virus or bacterial infection of the kidney that results
        in fluid build-up in the fish&rsquo;s abdomen, causing the fish to swell and
        the scales to stand on end, giving it the appearance of a pinecone.
        Treatment is dependent on what the cause is. While the true cause of dropsy
        symptoms is not always treatable, antibiotics or the use of Epsom Salt in a
        quarantine aquarium have been known to produce results. Infected fish should
        be removed from the aquarium to avoid spreading the disease to other fish.
