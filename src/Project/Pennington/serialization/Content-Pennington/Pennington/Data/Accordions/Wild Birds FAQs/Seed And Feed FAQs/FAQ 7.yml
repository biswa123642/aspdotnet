      Hint: Content
      Value: "Regardless of what season or weather conditions, know that birds are always around and enjoy supplementing their diet with wild bird feed. During spring and fall migration, since the kind of birds flying through yards can change drastically from day to day, providing more diverse premium mixes (including thistle seed, hulled seed, dried fruit, dried mealworms, etc.) can attract birds you may only see in your area on their long-distance journeys for a few weeks out of the year. Additionally, once warm spring weather arrives through to the beginning of winter weather, hummingbird feeders can be hung to attract hummingbirds and orioles. During summer heat, keep food that can spoil quickly (like nectar and suet) out of direct sunlight, and consider providing water to attract a wider variety of birds. In winter cold, provide foods that are high in calorie content (such as black oil sunflower seed) to help winter visitors generate the body heat they need. On a related note, during freezing or severe weather conditions, consider leaving up out-of-use bird houses that can be used for temporary shelter."
