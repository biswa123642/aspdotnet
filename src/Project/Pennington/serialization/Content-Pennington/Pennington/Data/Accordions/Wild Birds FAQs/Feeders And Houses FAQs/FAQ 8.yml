      Hint: Content
      Value: "If a new feeder is placed near a previous feeding spot familiar to birds, the new feeder may be found in minutes or up to two weeks. If there is no previous history however, the process can take several weeks or months! There are several things you can do to speed up the process: Place the feeder somewhere birds flying by will see it, but also within 10-15 feet of cover (brush pile, tree, etc.) to help birds feel safe. Start with a universally popular feed, such as Black Oil Sunflower Seed to make sure whoever the first visitors are, they will be happy (slowly transition to your preferred feed once the feeder is established). You can also place a little bit of seed nearby (on the top of the feeder, on the ground underneath, on deck railing nearby, etc.) to help catch the notice of new birds. Adding a nearby birdbath (especially with moving water, like a birdbath fountain) can be an incredibly effective way to draw attention to a new feeder. Lastly, monitor the feed levels in the feeder to make sure birds aren't feeding when you weren't around, and keep fresh seed stocked to get off on the right foot."
