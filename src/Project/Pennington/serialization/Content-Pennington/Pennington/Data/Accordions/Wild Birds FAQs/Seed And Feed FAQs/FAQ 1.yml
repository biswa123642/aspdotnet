      Hint: Content
      Value: |
        <p><strong>Black oil sunflower seed:</strong>&nbsp;Black oil sunflower seed is high in energy and has thin shells, making it the preferred food item for a wide variety of birds like cardinals, chickadees, titmice, finches, sparrows and woodpeckers.</p>
        <p><strong>Cracked corn:</strong>&nbsp;Corn is an inexpensive grain that is a favorite of birds like wild turkeys and ducks, while cracked corn will attract ground-eating birds like doves, quail, and sparrows.</p>
        <p><strong>Fruit:</strong>&nbsp;Robins, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and waxwings are all species that enjoy fresh and dried fruit (and dried seeds of fruits like pumpkins or apples). Oranges cut in half will often attract orioles as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Hulled sunflower seed:</strong>&nbsp;Hulled seeds are simply seeds with the shell removed. The combination of high nutritional value with ease of consumption makes hulled sunflower a favorite of all seed eating birds.</p>
        <p><strong>Mealworms:</strong>&nbsp;Live or dried larvae of the mealworm beetle provide a high protein treat for many birds such as chickadees, titmice, wrens, and nuthatches. It is one of the only food items that reliably attract bluebirds.</p>
        <p><strong>Millet:</strong>&nbsp;Millet is a favored food of many smaller, ground foraging birds, such as juncos and sparrows.</p>
        <p><strong>Milo:</strong>&nbsp;A reddish-colored, round grain, milo is favored by ground-feeding birds like sparrows, doves, quail, wild turkeys, towhees and jays.</p>
        <p><strong>Nyjer (thistle) seed:</strong>&nbsp;Often called "thistle" seed, nyjer attracts finches including American goldfinches, purple finches, pine siskins, and common redpolls.</p>
        <p><strong>Oats:</strong>&nbsp;Ground foraging species most likely to be attracted to oats include doves, quail, wild turkeys and juncos.</p>
        <p><strong>Peanut hearts:</strong>&nbsp;Best offered in a small hopper or on a platform feeder, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, and jays are most likely to take advantage of this food.</p>
        <p><strong>Peanuts:</strong>&nbsp;Larger birds like jays and woodpeckers may grab several peanuts at a time and fly off to hide them for later consumption. Smaller birds like chickadees, nuthatches, and titmice will have more success feeding on shelled peanuts. Avoid salted peanuts or peanuts that have been roasted with any coatings or flavorings.</p>
        <p><strong>Safflower:</strong>&nbsp;Resembling white sunflower seed, safflower attracts cardinals, nuthatches, sparrows and woodpeckers while not being preferred by bully birds like crows and blackbirds.</p>
        <p><strong>Suet:</strong>&nbsp;A good choice for attracting robins, orioles, wrens, chickadees, woodpeckers, bluebirds, sapsuckers and warblers, suet can be purchased as processed cake that includes seeds, berries, and other ingredients.</p>
        <p><strong>Nectar (sugar water):</strong>&nbsp;is the preferred food of hummingbirds and orioles.</p>
