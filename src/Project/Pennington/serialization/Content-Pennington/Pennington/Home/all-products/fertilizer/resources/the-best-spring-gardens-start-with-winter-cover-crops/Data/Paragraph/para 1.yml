        <p>If you're an avid gardener, the anticipation of spring planting builds over the winter. You might even stare out at your garden on cold winter days, thinking about the moment you can break soil. While the excitement of planting a garden never really diminishes, discovering that your garden space is full of weeds come spring can be disappointing. Luckily, there is something you can do to rest well over the winter: plant cover crops. Cover crops prepare the soil for spring and prevent winter weeds.</p>
        
        <h2>What are Cover Crops?</h2>
        
        <p>Cover crops are crops planted in an unused garden space and then removed when it's time to plant edible crops. Essentially, they are placeholders, keeping the soil active between growing seasons.</p>
        <p>Also known as "green manure," cover crops serve several purposes.<sup>1</sup> In addition to preventing weeds and fertilizing the soil, cover crops protect the soil from harsh winter weather, while keeping it loose by preventing erosion and compaction.</p>
