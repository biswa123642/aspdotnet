        <h2>Using the Pennington Seed Water Calculator</h2>
        <p>Your lawn's watering needs are influenced by many factors, including your region, weather and personal goals for its appearance. The <a href="/all-products/grass-seed/resources/water-rate-calculator2" target="_blank">Pennington Seed water calculator</a>&nbsp;helps take the guesswork out of watering, during normal conditions or in times of water shortages.</p>
        <p>By using current statistics for your location's real-time weather and its rates of evaporation from land and transpiration (or evaporation) from plants &mdash; collectively known as evapotranspiration rates &mdash; this interactive tool provides guidance whether you're watering for premium greenery or survival mode. Just plug in a few facts about your grass, goals and watering system, and let the calculator do the rest. Pennington Seed is dedicated to helping you grow the lushest, healthiest, water-conserving lawn possible.</p>
