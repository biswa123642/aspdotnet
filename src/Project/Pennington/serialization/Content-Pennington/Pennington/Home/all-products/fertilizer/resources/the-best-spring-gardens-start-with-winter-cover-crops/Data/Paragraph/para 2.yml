        <p>While it's easier to leave a garden space uncovered through winter, it's worth doing some work to establish a cover crop before winter arrives.</p>
        <p>The biggest benefit of cover crops is their effectiveness against weeds. Cover crops act like mulch to shade the soil, preventing sun exposure to weed seeds.<sup>2</sup> They also consume water and nutrients, leaving few resources on which weeds can survive. Rather than having a garden full of weeds like henbit and bittercress in the spring, growers enter the season with light, loose soil that is perfect for planting.</p>
        <p>Cover crops also keep the soil biologically active by providing a food source for beneficial organisms.<sup>2</sup> Insects, earthworms and different types of microorganisms feed on decomposing matter in the soil, converting rotting material to available nutrients.</p>
        <p>Cover crops fall into three categories,<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and each type of benefits the soil in a different way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Legumes. Clovers, alfalfa, peas and vetch are all common legume cover crops. The most notable feature of legumes is that they work with certain soil bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen in the soil that can be absorbed by plant roots. This is known as nitrogen fixation.<sup>4</sup></li>
            <li>Grasses. While they don't offer nitrogen fixation, grass cover crops, such as oats, rye and wheat, improve soil structure by preventing compaction and erosion.</li>
            <li>Non-Legume broadleaves.&nbsp;The roots of mustard, radish and buckwheat plants improve soil structure and remove excess nitrogen from the soil.<sup>5</sup></li>
        </ol>
