Once established, drought-resistant Smart Seed grasses stay green for up to three weeks without water.</p>
        <p><strong>Outstanding Performance: </strong>Smart Seed grasses do more than conserve water and resist drought. These superior varieties have been selected for performance under adverse conditions such as heat, cold, disease, insects and traffic as well. With Smart seed, you get top performance plus thick, lush grass and rich, healthy color.</p>
