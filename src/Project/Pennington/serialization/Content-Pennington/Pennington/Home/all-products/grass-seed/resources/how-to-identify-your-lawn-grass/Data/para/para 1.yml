        <p>Knowing how to identify your lawn grass is an important step in meeting its needs and growing a beautiful, sustainable lawn. If you're starting a new lawn from scratch, knowing what grass you have is easy. But when your lawn came with your home, lawn grass I.D. can be a guessing game. These steps to grass identification can help you narrow the field, identify your lawn grass, and put you and your lawn on the path to success:</p>

        <p>Your location provides the first clue to your grass type. Just like landscape shrubs and flowers, lawn grasses have climate limits. For your grass to survive winters and summers year after year, it must suit your grass-growing region.</p>
        <p>Most common perennial lawn grasses grown in the northern half of the United States are cool-season grasses. They get that name because their peak growth happens during the cool seasons of fall and spring. These common lawn grasses flourish in cool northern climates and die out in hot southern lawns.</p>
        <p>Common lawn grasses in the country's southern half are warm-season grasses, which peak in growth during hot summer months. The cold temperatures found in northern lawns cause these grasses to die over winter.</p>
        <p>If your lawn grass survives from year to year, identification starts with cool- or warm-season. In the transition zone, the region where northern and southern grasses hit their limits, your lawn may have cool- or warm-season grasses.</p>
