        <p>Finally, selecting certain cover crops can provide very specific advantages. Mustard, for example, suppresses disease and harmful organisms in the soil <sup>5</sup>, while legumes, such as Austrian peas, add nitrogen.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <h2>How to Plant Cover Crops</h2>
        <p>Select the right type of crop based on your needs, and then plant before weeds have time to take root.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your garden for cover crops immediately after fall vegetable plants are removed.<sup>7</sup> Remove all existing weeds, and then loosen the soil with a tiller or shovel to ensure good seed-to-soil contact.</li>
            <li>Fertilize the space with Lilly Miller All Purpose Lawn &amp; Garden Food 16-16-16&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1809E65BB04C4238B05ED02E18DFE976&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Lilly Miller All Purpose Plant Food 10-10-10</a>&nbsp;before seeding cover crops. This ensures that the soil is ready for you spring planting. Lilly Miller fertilizers are formulated for all types of vegetables.</li>
            <li>Plant seeds according to package instructions. Seed depth and spacing varies greatly, depending on the crop being planted. For example, Austrian peas should be planted 1-inch deep, while smaller seeds can be broadcast on the top of the soil at a rate of one seed per square inch.<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li>Water well after planting.</li>
        </ol>
