        <h2>3. <a name="TreatExistingPests">Treat Existing Pests</a></h2>
        <p>If you detect pests, treat the plants while they're still outdoors. Wash the pests off with a strong spray of water, and then spray all of the plant parts with <a href="https://gardentech.com/products/sevin/sevin-ready-to-use">Sevin Ready-to-Use</a>. Let the foliage dry, and then re-spray the plants with water. Wait seven days before repeating the treatment.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't see any active pests on your houseplants, it's best to wash and spray them with Sevin Ready-to-Use as a preventative measure. Once your houseplants are indoors, check them every two weeks for pests that might have returned.</p>
        <h2>4. <a name="AcclimateYourHouseplants">Acclimate Your Houseplants</a></h2>
        <p>Your indoor environment differs from the outdoors, especially in terms of light. To prevent transplant shock, slowly acclimate your houseplants to lower light conditions while they're still outdoors. Over five days, reduce the amount of light they receive by moving them to progressively more shaded locations outdoors each day. Once you move them indoors, plants may experience some leaf drop, which should stop once they adjust to the new light conditions.</p>
