        <br /><p>Perennial ryegrass is widely used throughout the United States, but the way it's used differs from region to region. This hard-working, fine-bladed grass wins fans with its fast germination rate and quick establishment. It's a valued component in permanent northern lawns and southern lawns in need of temporary winter color. Depending on where you live and your immediate lawn goals, perennial ryegrass may offer just what you need.</p>

        </ul><br /><h2><a name="PerennialRyegrassBasics">Perennial Ryegrass Basics</a></h2><br /><p>Perennial ryegrasses are used throughout the United States as turf grasses and high-quality pasture grasses for livestock. Despite its agricultural uses, perennial ryegrass isn't related to the rye plant that produces cereal grain. It is related to the turf grass known as annual ryegrass, but these two plants differ, too.</p>
        <p>As the name suggests, annual ryegrass is a short-lived grass used to provide quick color, short-term erosion control or temporary stability for a season. Turf-type perennial ryegrass is used in those same ways, but it comes back year after year in northern climates to establish a permanent lawn.</p>
        <p>Like many common turf grasses used for permanent northern U.S. lawns, perennial ryegrass is native to Europe and Asia.<sup>1</sup> It's not as cold-hardy as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AE203707184C477AB8090DB6B59FDE09&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Kentucky bluegrass</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E9E74E8EFEF84B619745C5F04A41DB0D&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">tall fescue</a>, but perennial ryegrass flourishes where summers are moderate and winters are cool. In the cool, humid Pacific Northwest, it has become one of the region's most widely used permanent lawn grasses, both on its own and mixed with other cool-season grasses.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <h2><a name="RyegrassForOverseedingSouthernLawns">Ryegrass For Overseeding Southern Lawns</a></h2>
        <p>Even though perennial ryegrass naturally suits northern climates, southern lawn owners use it extensively. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EB81614ED373435A88A451F2FA909053&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Warm-season grasses</a>&nbsp;used in the south and west, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8B832BE060A847128826904BCF0DDA32&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Bermudagrass</a>, go dormant and turn brown during cool winter months.

Fast-germinating perennial ryegrass creates a temporary green lawn for winter, then dies out when warm-season grasses green up and summer heat returns. Good cold and drought tolerance makes <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3721FB29B22B49FC93A0EB931EB71716&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Fairway Supreme Perennial Ryegrass</a>&nbsp;an excellent choice for winter overseeding in the southwest, where it is common to have green lawns year-round.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Perennial-Ryegrass/Closeup-Perennial-Ryegrass.jpg" /><br /><h2><a name="OtherPerennialRyegrassConsiderations">Other Perennial Ryegrass Considerations</a></h2><br /><p>Given the proper conditions, perennial ryegrass germinates faster than any other common lawn grass seed.<sup>2,3</sup> Once established, however, it spreads slowly. Unlike aggressive Kentucky bluegrass, which spreads by underground stems called rhizomes, perennial ryegrass is a bunch-forming grass. Like tall fescue, it naturally grows in clumps and spreads through vertical shoots known as tillers, rather than spreading by rhizomes or horizontal above-ground stems called stolons.</p>
        <p>Traditional perennial ryegrass varieties have relatively shallow roots, which historically limited their heat and drought tolerance compared to tall fescue or deep-rooted warm-season <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5FAA97A823F44827B5690E3BCAAF52FC&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zoysia grass.</a>&nbsp;However, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington-affiliated research and breeding programs</a>&nbsp;have developed improved varieties of perennial ryegrass with greater heat and drought tolerance.</p>

Once established, these improved varieties require up to 30% less water year after year than ordinary grass seed. They also require less mowing than common perennial or annual ryegrasses do.</p>
        <p>Perennial ryegrass is also a key component in cool-season grass seed mixes for northern and transition zone lawns and athletic fields. Its fast germination and rapid seedling growth provide quick color and stability, while slower germinating grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass get established. Perennial ryegrass prefers sun, but it will tolerate lightly shaded conditions.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Perennial-Ryegrass/Perennial-ryegrass-in-Pacific-Northwests-coastal-regions.jpg" /><br /><h2><a name="PerennialRyegrassLawnCareCalendar">Perennial Ryegrass Lawn Care Calendar</a></h2><br /><p>Perennial ryegrass, like other cool-season grasses, grows most vigorously during the cool fall and spring seasons. In permanent northern lawns, it slows down or goes dormant during summer months. To keep perennial ryegrass looking and performing its best, time your seasonal lawn care tasks to complement these natural cycles.</p>
        <p>Weather conditions can vary significantly within perennial ryegrass' extensive growing region, so let your lawn help guide your timing from year to year. If you're uncertain about typical frost dates and planting times in your local area, check with your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">county extension agent</a>. Then follow this perennial ryegrass lawn care calendar for a healthy, beautiful lawn.</p>
        <p><strong>MARCH THROUGH MAY</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>Start mowing when your lawn starts growing. Maintain perennial ryegrass at a height of 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches to keep growth dense and looking good. Bag the season's first clippings to avoid spreading winter <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">fungal disease</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Prevention and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Prevent crabgrass in your perennial ryegrass lawn while you fertilize in early spring. Apply <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4D628DBF106E4CADA70CF4EB800FAFC1&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen Crabgrass Preventer Plus Fertilizer III 30-0-4</a>&nbsp;<em>before</em> soil temperatures reach 55 degrees Fahrenheit and weed seeds start germinating. Do not apply to seeded or overseeded areas within 60 days after seeding.</p>
        <p><strong>Seeding and Overseeding</strong></p>
        <p>Like other cool-season grasses, perennial ryegrass germinates best with temperatures between 50&deg;F and 65&deg;F. Next to fall, spring is the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D63DCF0805FA413D809FE6A2A9C9975B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">best time to seed lawns</a>&nbsp;with Pennington Smart Seed Grass Seed + Fertilizer Perennial Ryegrass.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Control and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>With grass and weeds in active growth in late spring, feed your established lawn and control emerged broadleaf weeds with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9825BB355F154A2E891B819CB73AA765&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Weed &amp; Feed 30-0-4</a>. Do not apply to newly seeded areas until you mow new grass at least three times. Wait at least three weeks after application before reseeding.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>Water your established perennial ryegrass lawn so it receives about 1 inch of water per week, including rainfall. Water deeply and thoroughly to encourage deeper root growth.</p>
        <p><strong>JUNE THROUGH AUGUST</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>Increase your mowing height to 3 to 4 inches during periods of heat and low rainfall. Mow often enough that you never remove more than one-third of the blade at any one time.</p>
        <p><strong>Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Fertilize your perennial ryegrass lawn with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A20BEC695416488EAE14E4B1A9E6B3A4&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Lawn Fertilizer 30-0-4</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>Supplement rainfall with irrigation, as needed, so perennial ryegrass gets 1 to 1 1/4 inches of water per week.</p>
        <p><strong>Pest Control</strong></p>
        <p>Control lawn-damaging pests, including grubs and beetles, with <a href="https://gardentech.com/products/sevin/sevin-lawn-insect-granules" target="_blank">Sevin Lawn Insect Killer Granules</a>. Early control limits damage and prevents new generations of pests.</p>
        <p><strong>Soil Testing</strong></p>

Perennial ryegrass prefers soil pH of 5.5 to 7.5. In areas with overly acidic soil, such as parts of the Pacific Northwest, your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A9C4E0AAE8454C9CBC6D320EE685DECA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">lawn may need lime</a>&nbsp;to restore nutrient availability.</p>
        <p><strong>SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>Gradually decrease your mowing height to 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches as fall temperatures arrive. Keep mowing your perennial ryegrass lawn until growth stops.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Control and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Treat broadleaf weeds and fertilize established perennial ryegrass lawns with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=31FE5A46FCF54B21B4730E9684B7B254&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Winterizer Plus Weed &amp; Feed Fertilizer 22-0-14</a>&nbsp;six to eight weeks before your area's first expected frost. If you plan to overseed, spot-treat stubborn <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z">lawn weeds</a>&nbsp;and use Pennington UltraGreen Lawn Fertilizer 30-0-4 instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Seeding and Overseeding</strong></p>
        <p>Early fall is the best time to plant cool-season grasses, including perennial ryegrass. Seed northern lawns with Pennington Smart Seed Perennial Ryegrass about 45 days before your area's typical first fall frost. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1199218D755448F9043188507755D2E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Overseed</a>&nbsp;southern lawns for winter color once the warm-season grass starts to go dormant and turn brown and when overnight air temperatures drop near 65 to 70 Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>In northern lawns, gradually reduce watering. Supplement rainfall, as needed, so perennial ryegrass gets 1 inch of water every 10 to 14 days. In southern lawns, continue regular irrigation so that perennial ryegrass gets 1 inch of water per week.</p>
        <p><strong>Aeration and Dethatching</strong></p>
