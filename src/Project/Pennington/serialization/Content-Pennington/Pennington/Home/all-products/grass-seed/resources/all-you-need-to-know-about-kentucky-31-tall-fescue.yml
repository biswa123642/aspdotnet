        <br /><p>Tall fescue is an important turf grass in the United States today, but that wasn't always the case. Kentucky 31, known in the seed industry as KY-31 or K-31, helped <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E9E74E8EFEF84B619745C5F04A41DB0D&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">tall fescue grasses</a>&nbsp;transition from livestock pastures to lush, durable, manicured lawns. Lawn owners value its easy establishment, drought resistance and improved heat tolerance as well. If you're in the market for an economical, low-maintenance grass — with a bit of history thrown in — Kentucky 31 tall fescue may be for you.</p>

        </ul><br /><h2>KENTUCKY 31 TALL FESCUE HISTORY</h2><br /><p>Tall fescue grasses came to the U.S. from Europe in the 1800s. Durable and adaptable, these grasses gained wide use as "forage" or pasture grasses for grazing livestock. In 1931, a University of Kentucky professor heard about a remarkable tall fescue growing nearby. Upon seeing it, he recognized qualities that improved upon common forage grasses, including green color during cold weather and stability on erosion-prone slopes.</p>
        <p>Seed was taken from those long-established Kentucky fields and research ensued. In 1942, the grass was introduced into the agricultural seed market as Kentucky 31 tall fescue, named for the state and year in which it was discovered.1 It quickly gained favor for use in agriculture, conservation and erosion control.</p>
        <p>As Kentucky 31's popularity grew through the 1950s, its excellent disease resistance and resilience attracted attention. Among those keen on the grass' potential was Brooks Pennington, Jr., who was in the process of shifting Pennington Seed's focus from <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1F7A49EA86CD4AEFB283D033C4FA2FD3&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">agricultural seed products</a>&nbsp;to seeds for lawns and turf.</p>
        <p>In the late 1960s, Pennington introduced a proprietary seed treatment that helped seed establish faster and stay healthier. Known as Penkote, the process enabled Pennington to offer Kentucky 31, still known as a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C99811039044FB68CD303AB2E3040FA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">forage grass</a>, as a viable alternative to the more demanding turf grasses of the time. The move put low-maintenance, easy-care, disease-resistant lawns within the average homeowner's reach. In the process, Kentucky 31 became the original tall fescue lawn grass and an integral part of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DA3308DDE53C48759F1E554AAB6C8BC5&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Seed history,</a>&nbsp;leading the way for the modern turf-type tall fescue lawn grasses that followed.</p>
        <p>Today Kentucky 31 tall fescue seed is produced in major U.S. grass-growing regions from Missouri to Oregon, as evidenced on the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=049DA992419142B6861B097369C200EA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">seed tag</a>&nbsp;you'll find attached to all grass seed products.

Like other tall fescue varieties, KY-31 is best adapted to regions with moderate summers and cool winters. It is particularly well-suited to the south-central U.S. and the challenging turf-growing regions known as the transition zone. Where weather runs too hot for many cool-season grasses and too cold for most <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EB81614ED373435A88A451F2FA909053&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">warm-season grasses</a>, Kentucky 31 tall fescue shines.</p>
        <p>Tall fescues generally have greater heat tolerance than other cool-season grasses, but KY-31 offers better heat and drought tolerance than many tall fescue varieties. Its cold tolerance, which is greater than that of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BF7695A96AD446A88583DE2A7104697F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">perennial ryegrass</a>, also provides an advantage over warm-season transition zone grasses.</p>
        <p>In the years since K-31 moved into the lawn and turf marketplace, many new tall fescue lawn grasses have been developed. Research and breeding programs such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">NexGen Turf Research</a>&nbsp;and the Rutgers University program that developed the original turf-type tall fescue that led to Pennington The Rebels Brand have led the way. Compared to these more modern turf-type and dwarf tall fescue varieties, KY-31 has a lighter green color, coarser texture and wider blades.</p><br /><h2><a name="OtherKY-31CharacteristicstoConsider"><span style="color: #000000;">Other KY-31 Characteristics to Consider</span></a></h2><br /><p>As with other tall fescue varieties, Kentucky 31 germinates much more quickly than <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AE203707184C477AB8090DB6B59FDE09&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Kentucky bluegrass</a>.&nbsp;Its relatively deep roots in comparison to other common cool-season lawn grasses fortify its heat and drought tolerance.1 Though less tolerant of shade than fine fescues, KY-31 is more shade-tolerant than Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass or common warm-season grasses, such as sun-loving <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8B832BE060A847128826904BCF0DDA32&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Bermudagrass</a>.</p>
        <p>Like all tall fescue grasses, KY-31 is a bunch-forming grass that naturally grows in clumps. Creeping grass types spread by horizontal above-ground stems known as "stolons," or below-ground stems called "rhizomes." But Kentucky 31 spreads through vertical shoots known as "tillers," which grow from the plant's base. As a result, KY-31 rarely ventures outside its boundaries the way more aggressive spreading grasses often do.</p><br /><h2><a name="KY-31TallFescueLawnCareCalendar"><span style="color: #000000;">KY-31 Tall Fescue Lawn Care Calendar</span></a></h2><br /><p>As with all tall fescue grasses, KY-31 grows most vigorously during the cool seasons of fall and spring. By timing your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E14325A1605248F9956E3130C0D47817&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">major lawn care tasks</a>&nbsp;to complement these peak times, you can maximize the benefits to your KY-31 lawn. Seasonal weather patterns can be unpredictable, especially in transition regions, so let your grass help guide your lawn care timing.</p>
        <p>The farther north you live, the later spring comes to KY-31 lawns and the earlier fall arrives, so keep that timing in mind. If you're unsure when to expect spring and fall frosts in your local area, contact your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">county extension agent</a>. Then follow this lawn care calendar for a durable, versatile KY-31 lawn.</p>
        <p><strong>MARCH THROUGH MAY</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>Start mowing your Kentucky 31 lawn as soon as spring growth begins. Maintain KY-31 at tall fescue's recommended mowing height of 2 to 3 inches. Collect and remove the first clippings of the season to protect against the spread of winter-related <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">lawn disease</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Prevention and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Prevent crabgrass and feed your established KY-31 lawn in early spring. Apply <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4D628DBF106E4CADA70CF4EB800FAFC1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Crabgrass Preventer Plus Fertilizer III 30-0-4</a>&nbsp;any time before soil temperatures reach 55 degrees Fahrenheit &mdash; that's when crabgrass seeds start germinating. For newly seeded or overseeded areas, wait at least 60 days after seeding before you treat.</p>
        <p><strong>Seeding and Overseeding</strong></p>
        <p>Seed new areas or overseed thin KY-31 lawns to help maintain a uniform, dense look. KY-31 germinates best when soil temperatures are between 50&deg;F and 65&deg;F. Most local garden retailers carry affordable soil thermometers to ensure your timing is right.</p>
        <p><strong>Bare Spot Repair</strong></p>
        <p>Repair lawn damage in KY-31 lawns with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2192C66A39BD443C87F3EA130348C774&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington One Step Complete Tall Fescue</a>. Under proper growing conditions, this all-in-one product repairs bare spots in two weeks or less.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Control and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Feed your established KY-31 lawn and control emerged broadleaf weeds in late spring. Wait until weed and grass enter active growth, then apply <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9825BB355F154A2E891B819CB73AA765&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Weed &amp; Feed 30-0-4</a>. Make sure to follow label instructions, as excess fertilization in spring can stress grass and make it more susceptible to disease as weather warms and humidity increases.</p>
        <p>Avoid treating newly seeded areas until they've been mowed at least three times. Wait at least three weeks before overseeding treated areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>Supplement natural rainfall with irrigation as needed so your KY-31 lawn gets 1 inch of water per week. Deep, thorough watering encourages deep root growth.</p>
        <p><strong>JUNE THROUGH AUGUST</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>Increase your mowing height to 3 to 4 inches to help KY-31 resist the stress of summer heat and drought. Mow often enough so you never remove more than one-third of the blade in a single mowing.</p>
        <p><strong>Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Feed your KY-31 lawn with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A20BEC695416488EAE14E4B1A9E6B3A4&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Lawn Fertilizer 30-0-4</a>. The added iron helps keep your lawn looking healthy and green.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>KY-31's deep root growth helps protect against heat and drought stress, but <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FA7C95CF1EDA4B588571CA2211249D26&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">wise watering practices</a>&nbsp;build on that strength. KY-31 lawns require less water than Kentucky bluegrass, but more water than warm-season grasses such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5FAA97A823F44827B5690E3BCAAF52FC&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zoysia grass</a>. Water to ensure your established lawn gets 1 to 1 1/2 inches of weekly water under normal summer conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Pest Control</strong></p>
        <p>Destructive pests, including grubs, chinch bugs and billbugs, can damage KY-31 above and below ground. Protect your lawn for up to three months with <a href="https://gardentech.com/products/sevin/sevin-lawn-insect-granules" target="_blank">Sevin Lawn Insect Killer Granules</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Soil Testing</strong></p>
        <p>Simple soil testing confirms your soil pH and reveals if your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A9C4E0AAE8454C9CBC6D320EE685DECA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">lawn needs lime</a>&nbsp;or other <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6042EC370E1449AEAE9BB1C58548626E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">soil amendments</a>&nbsp;to restore pH balance and nutrient availability. Versatile KY-31 adapts to a broad range of soil types. It does best when soil pH stays between 5.5 and 7.5.</p>
        <p><strong>SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mowing</strong></p>
        <p>As cooler temperatures arrive, gradually return to KY-31's normal mowing height of 2 to 3 inches. Continue mowing until growth stops in northern areas. In southern regions, continue mowing KY-31 as conditions allow to maintain a uniform &mdash; not clumpy &mdash; look.</p>
        <p><strong>Weed Control and Fertilization</strong></p>
        <p>Prepare your established KY-31 lawn for winter and control active broadleaf weeds with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=31FE5A46FCF54B21B4730E9684B7B254&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen Winterizer Plus Weed &amp; Feed Fertilizer 22-0-14</a>. Apply this weed and feed fertilizer six to eight weeks before your typical first fall frost. If you're seeding or overseeding your lawn, feed with Pennington UltraGreen Lawn Fertilizer 30-0-4 and spot-treat <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">lawn weeds</a>&nbsp;instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Seeding and Overseeding</strong></p>
        <p>KY-13 lawns benefit from regular <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1199218D755448F9043188507755D2E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">overseeding</a>&nbsp;every one to three years.<sup>2</sup> Plant Pennington Kentucky 31 Grass Seed about 45 days before your typical first fall frost date so it can get established before winter cold arrives.</p>
        <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
        <p>Reduce supplemental watering in northern lawns so that KY-31 tall fescue gets 1 inch of water every 10 to 14 days. Continue watering southern transition lawns as needed so KY-31 receives at least 1 inch of water per week.</p>
        <p><strong>Aeration and Dethatching</strong></p>
        <p>Because of KY-31's bunch-forming growth, it rarely needs <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3D5EBDDD0F3647F18178255AD405847C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">dethatching</a>. For KY-31 lawns with compacted soil, fall <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FD07865F65CA47279D00EE9EA2AECE5C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">aeration</a>&nbsp;helps grass recover more quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Leaf Management</strong></p>
        <p>Rake or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9B281823FFE74821B9B6A0EAB9E7526A&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">mulch fallen tree leaves</a>&nbsp;to encourage healthy grass and reduce the risk of lawn disease.</p>
        <p><strong>DECEMBER THROUGH FEBRUARY</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Southern Kentucky 31 Lawns</strong></p>
        <p>Continue maintaining your KY-31 tall fescue lawn at normal mowing heights through the winter months as conditions allow. To keep KY-31 looking its winter best, ensure your lawn gets 1 inch of weekly water from natural precipitation and irrigation combined.</p>
        <p><strong>Northern Kentucky 31 Lawns</strong></p>
        <p>Keep your KY-31 tall fescue lawn free of winter debris. Maintain <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=28DE422F58A44408B5C99AD451DD8A45&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">mowers and turf tools</a>&nbsp;so they're ready for use. Flush areas damaged by de-icing salts or pet urine as spring thaws begin.</p>
