        <ol>

        <h2>1. <a name="PenningtonResearchDevelopment">Pennington Research &amp; Development</a></h2>
        <p>Pennington Smart Seed grasses are bred to overcome environmental challenges, give superior performance in your lawn, and look and feel beautiful under your feet. We breed these desirable traits into the very core of our grass seed.</p>
        <p>Pennington's <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z">NexGen Turf Research</a>, the largest private grass seed research facility in the United States, leads the industry in developing drought-tolerant, water-efficient grasses to help you create a beautiful, sustainable lawn. The research team at NexGen works six to seven years or more &mdash; measuring thousands of data points per year on potential grass selections &mdash; to bring the very best lawn grass cultivars to market under the Pennington Smart Seed label.</p>
        <p>Backed by more than just marketing, Smart Seed varieties are proven, through research, science and independent testing, to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=997F4AD467424A5580F7051F1C56B769&amp;_z=z">outperform ordinary grasses</a>&nbsp;on multiple counts. The drought-tolerant, water-conserving grass varieties in your Smart Seed bag save you up to 30 percent water year after year, for the life of your lawn, compared to ordinary grass seed. These top-performing grasses stay green up to three weeks without water once they establish in your lawn.</p>
        <p>Water conservation is a priority, but Pennington grasses don't stop there. To earn the Smart Seed label, grasses must deliver the other traits you desire for your lawn, from faster establishment and outstanding color to pleasing texture and improved resistance to disease and insect pests.</p>
        <h2>2. <a name="PenkoteSeedTechnology">What's the connection between the company and the seed?</a></h2>
        <p>When you buy Pennington, you can be confident your seed has everything it needs to succeed. Seed-enhancing <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D215D4DCEA124D6A9FB6375CD63C5AD1&amp;_z=z">Penkote seed technology</a>&nbsp;ensures that. The Penkote process seals your seed inside a protective layer of fungicide and growth stimulant. This protects seed during germination and early growth when grass is most vulnerable to fungal disease and loss. Penkote's green color also helps hide the seed from birds.</p>
        <p>With Penkote seed technology, the grass seed you buy for your lawn enjoys improved germination, enhanced growth, better establishment and increased survivability. The result is faster, stronger, healthier seedling growth and a thicker, healthier lawn for you and your family.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Quality-Grass-Seed--Buying-the-Best/nexgen_turf_cultivars.jpg" /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: lighter;">Pennington's portfolio of products is backed by industry-leading research.</em></div>
        <h2>3. <a name="PenningtonFarmers">Pennington Farmers</a></h2>
        <p>Pennington is the only grass seed company that <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=26BFB31E5A094E04BBCB4EE0C4A8E60B&amp;_z=z">works directly with farmers</a>&nbsp;and uses their own distribution network to get the best grass seed possible into your hands. Other grass seed companies are in the business of just buying and selling seed. Pennington's connection to the seed you buy starts before that seed was ever grown.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, Pennington committed to working directly with seed farmers to develop a network of dedicated growers to grow your grass seed. Pennington can speak to its seed quality, right down to the growing practices of the farmers who grew it. These valued relationships with seed farmers help produce the best grass seed you can buy, from the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5DE09C34418F4DF2B0CDAC96EC22EA0B&amp;_z=z">field to the final product.</a></p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Quality-Grass-Seed--Buying-the-Best/high_germination_rates.jpg" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Grass seed quality and high germination rates go hand in hand.</em></p>
        <h2>4. <a name="PenningtonStandards">Pennington Standards</a></h2>
        <p>One valuable indicator of grass seed quality is found on the seed bag. Government regulations require that every lot of grass seed goes through an independent testing process. The results of that testing appear on every grass seed bag in what's known as a seed tag. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=049DA992419142B6861B097369C200EA&amp;_z=z">information provided on a seed tag</a>&nbsp;tells you about the composition and quality of what's inside.</p>
        <p>Many factors influence seed germination, including <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D63DCF0805FA413D809FE6A2A9C9975B&amp;_z=z">planting at the best time</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=59FD490E7C224592949B73A03077CB91&amp;_z=z">planting seed properly</a>, but seed tags reveal the actual germination rates seen during testing. This rate indicates the percentage of seeds you can expect to germinate under proper conditions, based on the testing that specific lot received.</p>
        <p>In addition to independent testing, Pennington carries out a rigorous internal seed testing program. You can count on Pennington seed products to exceed the national requirements for grass seed germination rates. This ensures the seed you buy meets the standards reflected in the Pennington guarantee.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Quality-Grass-Seed--Buying-the-Best/best_quality_grass_seed.jpg" /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: lighter;">Lush, vibrant lawns start with the best quality grass seed.</em></div>
