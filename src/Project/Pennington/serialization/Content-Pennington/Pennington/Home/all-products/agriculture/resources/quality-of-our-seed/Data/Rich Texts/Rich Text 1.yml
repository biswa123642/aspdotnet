        <div><strong>Wintergrazer 70 Rye</strong></div>
        <p>Wintergrazer 70 was selected for wider leaves, increased tillering and greater forage production. Wintergrazer 70 is known for consistently high yields, uniform growth and excellent coverage.</p>
        <div><strong>Nutrient Scavenger</strong></div>
        <p>Rye is the best cool-season cereal cover for scavenging unused soil N. Ryes quick-growing, fibrous root system can take up and hold as much as 100 lbs N/A until spring. A Georgia study
        estimated rye captured from 69 to 100 percent of the residual N after a corn crop. Rye also pulls potassium from deep in the soil profile to increase exchangeable K at the soil surface.</p>
