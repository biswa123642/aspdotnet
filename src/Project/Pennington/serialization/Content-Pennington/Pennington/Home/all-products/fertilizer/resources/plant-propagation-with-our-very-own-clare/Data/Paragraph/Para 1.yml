        <p>Meet Clare - an avid gardener, plant propagator and Atlanta-based Central Garden &amp; Pet employee who will help us start vegetable seeds indoors for spring planting outdoors. A popular gardening technique, plant propagation, is the process of growing new plants from seeds, cuttings, bulbs and other plants or plant parts. For most of the country, the warm growing months of spring are still several weeks away and starting plants indoors is an easy way to get a head start on the season for longer germinating and maturing plants. However, when starting seeds indoors, timing is important, as the plants need to be large enough to transplant outdoors at their normal planting time. &nbsp; Knowing when to start your seeds and transplant them outdoors will help to maximize your harvest. Unfortunately, there are no hard rules for this and is dependent on the climate for your particular area, but Clare will be providing lots of information and resources to help. First, let's find your zone by clicking on the map below. Clare is in Atlanta, so all of her posts correlate with <a href="-/media/BA1A70FCEF8C427BB629E452A84E4965.ashx" target="_blank">Zone 7.</a></p>
