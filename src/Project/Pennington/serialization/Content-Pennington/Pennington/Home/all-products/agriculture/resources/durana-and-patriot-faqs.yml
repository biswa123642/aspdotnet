        <br /><strong>Do intermediate white clovers like Durana and Patriot cause bloat problems in cattle?</strong><br />
        Certain nutrient rich legumes such as ladino or white clover and alfalfa as well as lush annual grasses<br />
        can potentially cause bloat in cattle. However, bloat hazard from legumes is greatly reduced when the<br />
        pasture contains at least 50% grass. Hungry cattle should be fed good quality dry hay prior to being<br />
        turned on to a lush clover pasture. Slowly introducing cattle to pastures with lush clover stands by limit<br />
        grazing them for a few days helps prevent bloat occurrence. Commercially available &ldquo;bloat blocks&rdquo; are<br />
        also helpful in reducing bloat attacks. Bloat potential is greatest during rapid plant growth periods in the<br />
        spring.
        <p><strong>When drilling clover using a no-till drill what is the proper drill depth?</strong><br />
        One-eight inch maximum. Successful seed placement can occur if the seed are broadcast directly behind<br />
        the drill&rsquo;s shoes and in front of the press wheels. To do this, disconnect the tubes from the small seed<br />
        box where it enters the drill&rsquo;s shoes and secure the tubes behind the shoes or in front of the press wheels<br />
        with wire or cable ties. This allows the seed to be metered out on the soil surface and pressed down into<br />
        the soil by the press wheels. This practice will ensure that the seed are not planted too deep.</p>
        <p><strong>What are some management techniques to help insure that frost seeded white clover establishes<br />
        and remains persistent?</strong><br />
        Tiny clover seedlings can be overwhelmed by lush spring fescue growth so it is important to keep the<br />
        fescue forage in check by periodically grazing or mowing it during the spring following clover planting.<br />
        This reduces competition during establishment and allows the clover seedlings to receive sunlight<br />
        needed for early growth and development. Proper fertilization is also important. Clover forage is<br />
        typically higher in content of phosphorous (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and certain<br />
        micronutrients. Therefore, fertilizer requirements for these major nutrients in clover mixed pastures may<br />
        be somewhat higher than those for grass only production. Soil tests should be taken ahead of planting<br />
        clover and then every 2 or 3 years to insure proper levels of P, K, and micronutrients are available.<br />
        During the year after planting, limit nitrogen fertilization to no more than 25 or 30 pounds of actual<br />
        nitrogen/acre. This encourages clover nitrogen fixation and helps reduce grass competition with the<br />
        clover. With clover mixed pastures, grazing management is particularly important. Periodic grazing on a<br />
        regular basis throughout the year removes tall grass and allows penetration of sunlight down into the<br />
        grass canopy to reach young clover seedlings and/or new growth from clover stolons. Using a rotational<br />
        system of grazing greatly enhances clover persistence as it allows perennial clover varieties like Durana<br />
        to re-foliate and build up energy reserves for times of heavy grazing or during periods of heat and<br />
        drought stress.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Durana &amp; Patriot white clovers have to reseed themselves to come back each year?</strong><br />
        No. While Durana and Patriot both produce abundant amounts of seed and are excellent re-seeders, they<br />
        are true perennials that survive from crowns and stolons to return each year. These clovers were bred to<br />
        have a high stolon density which greatly enhances their persistence, grazing tolerance and ability to<br />
        compete with companion pasture forages.</p>
        <p><strong>Annual clover seed varieties are often considerably cheaper than perennial clover varieties<br />
        like Durana. Is it worth spending the extra money on perennial clover?</strong><br />
        When shopping for forages, seed cost per acre should be considered over seed cost per pound.<br />
        This is because different varieties or types within forage species may call for different seeding<br />
        rates. For example, depending on the type of clover, seeding rates can range from 2 lbs. to 20<br />
        lbs. or more seed per acre. Another factor to consider is expected stand life. Annual clovers<br />
        only last a single growing season while a perennial clover like Durana or Patriot remains<br />
        productive 3-5 years or longer. While perennial clovers may cost more per pound, prorated<br />
        establishment costs are often much lower than those of annual types that must be seeded every<br />
        year.</p>
        <p><strong>Can Durana or Patriot clover be overseeded into stockpiled fescue pastures?</strong><br />
        While established stands of fescue and Durana or Patriot white clover work well together in a stockpile<br />
        forage system, do not attempt to fall establish a new stand of clover in stockpiled fescue. If clover is to<br />
        be added to the pasture mix, it is best done by frost seeding it in late winter or early spring after the<br />
        accumulated fescue forage has been consumed. This exposes the ground for better seed-soil contact,<br />
        allows greater sunlight penetration and reduces competition for the young clover seedling.</p>
        <p><strong>What does it mean to &ldquo;inoculate&rdquo; clover seed prior to seeding? How is it done?</strong><br />
        Clover is a legume and thus is able to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into a form that<br />
        it can use to grow and thrive. It does this through the aid of bacteria that live in the soil. The bacteria<br />
        imbed themselves into clover roots forming nodules that capture and convert the nitrogen. To insure that<br />
        the proper nitrogen fixing bacteria is present in the soil, a bacterial inoculant is applied to the seed as a<br />
        coating. Some clover varieties like Durana and Patriot come pre-inoculated whereby the proper<br />
        inoculant is already on the seed. Varieties that are not pre-inoculated must have an inoculant applied by<br />
        hand just prior to planting. This is done by purchasing the powdered inoculant separately and applying it<br />
        to the seed just prior to planting.</p>
        <p><strong>What preparations are needed to frost seed clover in existing grass pastures?</strong><br />
        Pastures slated for frost seeding to clover should be identified well in advance of planting. If not already<br />
        done, a soil sample should be taken from the area to be planted to determine soil nutrient content and<br />
        pH. Apply fertilizer and lime as recommended by the soil test. The area should be scouted for broadleaf<br />
        weed pests and an appropriate herbicide applied if needed. Be sure to refer to the label for herbicide<br />
        residual info and plant-back times for clover. Prior to planting, existing forage should be grazed down<br />
        close to expose more of the soil surface and provide optimum seed/soil contact. This also allows the<br />
        young developing clover seedlings to compete with the existing pasture forage.</p>
        <p><strong>Can clover be established in a pasture with a history of broadleaf weeds?</strong><br />
        This is a common question because many of the herbicides used to control pasture weeds will kill or<br />
        severely injure legumes. However, with a little planning, perennial white clovers like Durana and<br />
        Patriot can be successfully added and maintained in pastures with a history of weed problems. The key<br />
        to success is to reduce the weed population in the pasture prior to planting clover. This process begins 6-<br />
        12 months prior to planting clover. Pastures should be scouted from November through early March for<br />
        winter annual and perennial broadleaf weeds such as thistle, henbit, chickweed, cudweed, sorrel,<br />
        plantain, buttercup, etc. If needed, apply an appropriate herbicide. The pasture(s) should be re-scouted<br />
        from May through early July for summer annual and perennial broadleaf weeds like dogfennel, bitter<br />
        sneezeweed, horsenettle, spiney amaranth, pigweed, etc. and an appropriate herbicide applied if needed.<br />
        Following such a program should adequately reduce pasture weed populations for 3-5 years; a period of<br />
        time that easily allows clover to more than pay for itself. It is important to note that pasture herbicides<br />
        vary in their soil persistence, therefore producers should read and follow any label restrictions when<br />
        applying an herbicide prior to legume establishment.</p>
