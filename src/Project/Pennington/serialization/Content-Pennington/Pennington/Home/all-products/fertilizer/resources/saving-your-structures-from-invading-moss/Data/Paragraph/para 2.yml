        <p>You can't control rain, fog and humidity that keep structural mosses happy and hydrated, but you can interfere with moss's ability to stay moist. Effective structural moss controls, such as those in the <a href="https://www.mossout.com/all-products" target="_blank">Lilly Miller Moss Out!</a>&nbsp;line of moss control products for roofs, walks and structures, breach the protection that helps moss cells retain moisture and cause moss cells to dry out thoroughly and die. With moss dried and dead, you can remove what remains and prevent recurrences.</p>
        <p>Moss-fighting products such as economical <a href="https://www.mossout.com/all-products/moss-out-for-roofs-walks" target="_blank">Lilly Miller Moss Out! Roofs &amp; Walks</a>&nbsp;concentrate work through the power of an active ingredient known as ammoniated soap of fatty acids. These fast-acting, pesticidal soap products coat moss and disrupt its protective layer,<sup>1 </sup>similar to the way household dishwashing liquids cut through grease. As the fatty acids break through, cells lose moisture quickly, and mosses dry out and die. With results in just a few hours, these pesticidal soaps kill structural moss on roofs, walkways and other surfaces. Reapply annually or whenever new moss growth appears. Unlike many moss killers used on lawns, these products won't stain concrete, pavement, wood or stucco.</p>
