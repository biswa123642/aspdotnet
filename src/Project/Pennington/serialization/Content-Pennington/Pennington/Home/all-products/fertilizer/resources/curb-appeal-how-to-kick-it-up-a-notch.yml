        <br /><p>The first impression your lawn and landscape make when someone pulls up out front has a significant impact on your home's value. Enhancing your property's &ldquo;curb appeal" can boost its price by up to 17 percent &mdash; and lawn and landscaping upgrades matter just as much as improvements to your house itself.1 Whether it's pride in ownership or you're testing marketplace waters, upgrading your lawn and landscape along these four avenues can help you kick your home's curb appeal up a notch:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving lawn quality</li>
            <li>Keep pests off the lawn</li>
            <li>Enhancing foundation plantings</li>
            <li>Adding landscape focal points</li>
            <li>Expanding landscape color</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Improving Lawn Quality</h2>
        <p>A healthy, luxuriant lawn ties the rest of your landscape together. It also gives onlookers an impression of how the rest of your property may be maintained. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=41B057B091DA49AD9DE39FD20BBDF373&amp;_z=z">Quality grasses</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z">suited to your location</a>, and regular lawn maintenance help keep your home's curb appeal at peak.

        <h2>Keep pest off the lawn</h2>
        <p>Lawns are highly susceptible to insects, such as fleas, ticks, ants, chinch bugs, and many more pests. Visible signs can be circular bare spots, brown patches, or dry, thinned grass. Treat your lawn with <a href="https://gardentech.com/products/sevin/sevin-lawn-insect-granules" target="_blank">Sevin Insect Killer Lawn Granules</a>, using a drop or broadcast spreader. The granules kill insects by contact above and below the surface, will not harm the lawn, and continues protecting for up to 3 months. </p>
        <h2>Enhancing Foundation Plantings</h2>
        Shrubs, small trees and flowers planted around your home's foundation accent your home's best features. It's important to think in terms of year-round appeal, and incorporate plants that fit the bill. “Evergreens" in colors from green and gold to blue with purple tinges provide color, texture and shape in every season.<br />
        <br />
        Foundation plantings soften your home's lines and help guide visitors' eyes — and feet — straight to your entry door. Taller plants at building corners suggest extra width and don't block views from inside. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.penningtongarden.com/" target="_blank">Decorative containers</a>, dressed for the season, frame your doorway with color and life. Plants from side to side don't have to match, but repeating similar plant types and shapes adds balance and beauty that attracts attention from the curb.<br />
        <br />
        Plants such as ornamental grasses provide eye-catching movement and grace, while summer-blooming shrubs highlight your home long after spring's explosion of blooms has passed.<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736A0FAE310F4B39AE16707F3702CA23&amp;_z=z" target="_blank"> </a><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=65FD75CFCA3944B5BF52EC27178C342E&amp;_z=z">A complete, balanced fertilizer</a>, such <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D222D474DC2F457EAF0F03EBE5BC7E82&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen All Purpose Plant Food 10-10-10</a>, provides foundation plants with solid nutrition to fuel healthy foliage and abundant blooms.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/fertilizer/Curb-Appeal-How-to-Kick-It-Up-a-Notch/Front-lawn-and-curb-appeal.jpg" /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;"><em>Repetition in plant choices creates balance and harmony from the curb.</em></span></div>
        <h2>Adding Landscape Focal Points</h2>
        Planted alone as striking specimens or in combination with other plants, trees are landscape stars. They shade homes in summer and shield homes in winter, reducing cooling and heating costs, plus they buffer traffic noise and visibility. When it comes to curb appeal, focal points such as fountains, statuary or benches are often best left to private spaces. However, adding a single tree to your landscape can increase home value up to 2 percent.<sup>1</sup><br />
        <br />
        Before you plant, check out the view from the curb and from inside. Trees act as natural focal points that cause your eyes to rest on them. They can draw attention away from undesirable areas, such as a neighbor's uninviting wall, or focus attention on a pleasant view. They also help define property boundaries and provide cohesion between foundation plantings and your outer lawn.<br />
        <br />
        Trees that have interesting or colorful bark, such as exfoliating white-barked birch trees or cinnamon-red paperbark maples, create landscape highlights that appeal with or without leaves. Keeping trees pruned of any damaged branches keeps them looking their best, and helps light reach grass and plants growing beneath.<br />
        <br />
        A premium landscape fertilizer designed especially for ornamental landscape plants, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=57EE0EF99FF14046AE415B231E7C0C15&amp;_z=z">Pennington Nursery and Landscape Fertilizer 14-7-7</a>, helps keep your tree investment healthy, strong and beautiful.

        <p>
        While luxuriant green dominates a healthy, vibrant landscape, eye-catching plants in other colors offer short- and long-term boosts in curb appeal. Plants with colorful foliage, such as purple or green-and-gold variegated leaves, add colorful complements to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=33FE18784D5D4187B3667DF765BDB3AC&amp;_z=z">no-fuss favorites</a>&nbsp;that pack in color at summer's peak. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ECE736410CC244C496163A1D26541E25&amp;_z=z">Native shrubs</a>&nbsp;with persistent fruit add curb-worthy color and go over big with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E19CCE0E49F64D9BB2BD6736B5297228&amp;_z=z">songbirds and other welcome wildlife</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Use bursts of landscape color to accent your home's exterior, particularly door and window trim colors. Windows boxes filled with vining red geraniums provide a perfect complement to a cherry-red door. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=96D045E98D24490991CFED5255A3EABC&amp;_z=z">Soft hydrangeas</a>&nbsp;in pinks, purples and blues light up soothing neutrals. Seasonal displays &mdash; from <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=80DB3DE94ECA4824AC2A6732CB5F3BE7&amp;_z=z">cool-weather pansies</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5001A332BA148729E7DED2BBFB25BA8&amp;_z=z">springtime bulbs</a>&nbsp;to potted <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=83F528AC0AD04BB5A2C286650239A877&amp;_z=z">summer tropicals</a>&nbsp;or fall mums &mdash; deliver color, excitement and attention to your door.<br />
        <br />
        Through it all, keep an eye on low-maintenance, easy-care additions that don't mean extra work for you. A high-quality plant food such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EFF1A9DD1D834E4B936FD6509D4013FF&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen Colorblooms &amp; Bulbs Plant Food 15-10-10</a>&nbsp; gives blooming plants and bulbs the nutrients needed for vigorous healthy growth and abundant blooms. Then it keeps on feeding for up to four months, while you and passersby enjoy the view.<br />
