        <br /><p>When lawn disease strikes, your dreams of a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3824943D6FB5400595AB06811D58D745&amp;_z=z">thick, beautiful lawn</a>&nbsp;may seem to slip out of reach. But the solution to your problems can be as simple as disease I.D. and changes in your lawn care routine. Most <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">common lawn diseases</a>&nbsp;start with fungal pathogens that can't flourish unless conditions favor their growth. With proper lawn disease identification and disease-fighting culture, you can control disease and enjoy a healthy lawn.</p>
        <p>Brown patch disease strikes lawns from late spring through summer months, continuing into fall. All parts of the grass plant &mdash; from roots to blade tips &mdash; are affected by this disease. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8B832BE060A847128826904BCF0DDA32&amp;_z=z">Bermudagrass,</a><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BF7695A96AD446A88583DE2A7104697F&amp;_z=z">perennial ryegrass,</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E9E74E8EFEF84B619745C5F04A41DB0D&amp;_z=z">tall fescue</a>&nbsp;are common brown patch targets. The disease often attacks fine fescues and Kentucky bluegrass as well.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms and signs:</strong> Brown patch may show itself as early as spring green-up, especially in Bermudagrass lawns. Sunken, circular patches of dead, tan grass appear, measuring up to 3 feet in diameter. The patches expand up to 20 feet wide, ringed with smoky, grayish margins of wilted, dark, dying grass.</li>
            <li><strong>Contributing factors:</strong> High humidity combined with hot temperatures during spring and fall favor the development of brown patch disease. Overfertilizing, overwatering, heavy thatch buildup, and mowing too short contribute to the disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural control:</strong> Fight brown patch disease with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FA7C95CF1EDA4B588571CA2211249D26&amp;_z=z">good water management</a>&nbsp;to avoid overwatering. Water early in the day, so grass dries well by night. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer, and dethatch if your thatch layer is more than 1/2 inch thick. Follow <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z">guidelines for proper mowing</a>&nbsp;to avoid mowing too short.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When cultural controls fail to manage fungal lawn diseases, a lawn fungicide can help. As with garden fungicides, early treatment is key to preventing fungal pathogens from germinating and spreading. Many effective fungicides are available only to lawn professionals. Your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local county extension agent</a>&nbsp;is an excellent source for information on lawn fungicides and their use for lawn diseases.</p>
        <p>For any type of lawn disease, choosing disease-resistant grass varieties plays an important role in disease prevention and control. Superior grass varieties such as purebred <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z">Pennington Smart Seed</a>&nbsp;grasses are backed by decades of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z">industry-leading research and breeding</a>&nbsp;to provide you with the finest in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=997F4AD467424A5580F7051F1C56B769&amp;_z=z">sustainability-enhancing lawn grasses</a>&nbsp;with outstanding disease resistance.</p>
