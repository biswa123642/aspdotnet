        <br /><p>When many homeowners envision their ideal lawn, cool-season grasses are the kind of lawn that comes to mind. With rich color, lush growth and textures that feel great beneath bare feet, cool-season grasses epitomize the classic lawn, but they're not for every lawn owner.</p>
        <p>If your lawn lies in the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z">northern half of the United States</a>, these grass types offer the best choices for your lawn. If you live farther south, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E16FF002F43849D1B87F4A13B44FF61F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">warm-season grasses</a>&nbsp;probably suit your lawn best. The following common cool-season lawn grasses create thick, lush, beautiful northern lawns:</p>

        <p><a name="TallFescue"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tall Fescue</strong></span></a><strong> -</strong> The most drought- and heat-tolerant of the common cool-season lawn grasses, <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333;">with a bunch type growth habit</span>&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E9E74E8EFEF84B619745C5F04A41DB0D&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">tall fescue</a>&nbsp;grows deep, resilient roots.

These cold-tolerant grasses include both bunch type and spreading types.</p>
        <p>Most northern lawns contain a mixture of these cool-season grass types, combining the best qualities of each one to create a versatile, adaptable, rich green lawn.</p>

Match your grass seed to your lawn's sun and shade.</strong></span></a></p>
        <p>In general, all lawn grasses prefer abundant sunlight, but most lawns include some shade. By matching grasses to your light conditions, you help ensure all areas of your lawn do well. Seed mixes such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8B64434F3D9B4DA8A5CB97DAD578F559&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Smart Seed Sun &amp; Shade</a>&nbsp;contain a mix of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5EB97CBE2B894AD3BBF14503E19679FE&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">grass seed for sun and shade</a>&nbsp;to help achieve this goal. Kentucky bluegrass flourishes in full sun. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass tolerate light shade, but fine fescues grow well in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F7A51AF54D4641D08202A5E054ACEDE6&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">shaded lawn areas</a>&nbsp;with as few as two to four hours of direct sun.</p>
        <p><a name="Watertopromotedeeperrootgrowthanddiscouragedisease"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2. Water to promote deeper root growth and discourage disease.</strong></span></a></p>
        <p>Most established cool-season grasses need about 1 inch of water per week from rainfall or irrigation to stay healthy and green. But <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FA7C95CF1EDA4B588571CA2211249D26&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">how you water your lawn</a>&nbsp;makes a difference. Frequent, shallow watering encourages roots to stay close to the surface, where they're more vulnerable to heat and drought. Deep, less frequent watering encourages roots to grow deeper, where they're protected from environmental stress. Watering early in the day allows grass to dry before nightfall and helps <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">prevent common lawn diseases</a>.</p>
        <p><a name="Mowtomaintainyourlawn'srecommendedmowingheight"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3. Mow to maintain your lawn's recommended mowing height.</strong></span></a></p>
        <p>Lawns do best when you mow according to their growth and height, not the calendar. It's important to never remove more than one third of the grass's height in a single mowing or you'll impair healthy root growth. Repeatedly mowing too short also weakens your lawn and puts it at risk for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">lawn weeds</a>, disease and drought. During peak times of growth, you'll need to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">mow more often to maintain proper height</a>. During hot summer months, gradually raise your mowing height. Then gradually reduce it again in fall.</p>
        <p><a name="Stayontopofsummerheat,droughtanddormancy"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4. Stay on top of summer heat, drought and dormancy.</strong></span></a></p>
        <p>Cool-season grasses grow best in areas with moderate summers and cold winters. Extreme, extended summer heat can cause these grasses to go dormant and turn brown. While they typically bounce back with irrigation or when normal conditions return, the varieties you choose for your lawn make a big difference. Once established, drought-tolerant <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Smart Seed</a>&nbsp;grasses require up to<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=997F4AD467424A5580F7051F1C56B769&amp;_z=z" target="_blank"> 30 percent less water than ordinary grasses</a>. Developed through years of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">industry-leading research</a>, these water-conserving varieties also stay green up to three weeks without watering.</p>
        <p><a name="Watchforwinterdamageandmakequickrepairs"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5. Watch for winter damage and make quick repairs.</strong></span></a></p>
        <p>Cool-season grasses do well in cold weather, even staying green under snow, but northern winters present some other risks for lawns. De-icing salts used on sidewalks and roadways can build up in soil and injure grass. Snowblowers and shovels leave tracks and divots behind, and fungal lawn diseases such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=95D75D190F01479DAC25EC4C5588FEEC&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">snow mold</a>&nbsp;sneak in.
