        <p>Once dead, light to average moss growth washes away with rains where pitched roofs allow. For heavier growth, non-pitched roofs or flat surfaces, cleaning after treatment is still simple. When practical, remove as much dead moss as possible by hand, broom or rake, and then clean the surface with a cleaner, such as Lilly Miller Moss Out! Heavy Duty Cleaner, which is ideal for use with pressure washers. Always follow product instructions for the intensity of cleaning needed and the type of surface being cleaned.</p>
        <p>Prevent moss from returning by treating your roofs and surfaces annually, right before rainy seasons, at the reduced rates for preventive care on your moss control product's label. Take extra steps to lessen the chance of new moss growth. Mosses tend to gather wherever moisture, shade and poor air circulation combine. North-facing surfaces, structures shaded by tree limbs and areas covered with leaf debris may be hardest hit. Prune back overhanging limbs to let more light into problem areas, and keep roofs and surfaces clean of leaf debris to make them less inviting to moss.</p>
        <p>If structural moss makes a move on your home, timely, effective controls put an end to unsightly growth and potential damage. With the help of Lilly Miller Moss Out! and CORRY'S Moss B Ware formulations, you can kill structural moss and help your roofs, structures and other surfaces stay safe and moss-free.</p>
