        <p>If you're still stumped about the type of grass you have, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">your local county extension agent</a>&nbsp;may be able to help. If you take in a sample, take a whole plant from root to tip, including a seed head if you have it. Some agents may be willing to stop by and look at your lawn in person.</p>
