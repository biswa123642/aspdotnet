        Azaleas, camellias, rhododendrons and blueberries are just four of the plants that love to sink their roots in acidic soil. Gardeners label these plants “acid-loving," but it's not really acid these plants seek. Rather, they crave the nutrients that low-pH, acidic soil provides. Give acidic-loving plants the soil, care and nutrients they need, and they'll reward you with beauty and bounty.<br />
        
        <h2>Understanding the pH Connection</h2>
        
        <p>There's no way around it: Plant health is inextricably linked to soil pH. When soil pH moves above the neutral point of 7.0 to what's known as the alkaline range, the some nutrients get "tied up"<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>so plants can't use them. The same thing happens when soil pH moves below 7.0 to the range known as acidic. When soil pH shifts, quantities of soil nutrients don't necessarily change, but their availability to plants does.</p>
        <p>Most plants grow best with soil in the slightly acidic range of 6.0 to 7.0, where major plant nutrients stay readily available. But some essential nutrients, including iron, become more available to plants as pH levels drop. Acid-loving plants need larger quantities of these nutrients, so they thrive when soil stays near 5.5 pH. At these acidic levels, acid loving plants can access the nutrients they need for optimal health, beauty and performance.</p>
