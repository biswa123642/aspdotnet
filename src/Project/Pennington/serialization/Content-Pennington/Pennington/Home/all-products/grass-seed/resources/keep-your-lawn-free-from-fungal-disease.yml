        <br /><p>When disease hits your lawn grasses, control can be difficult unless you know how to identify lawn and grass diseases and understand the causes behind them. Many common lawn and grass diseases have fungal problems at their source. Fortunately, proper lawn maintenance and care prevent and resolve most fungal lawn diseases. To keep your lawn healthy and fungus-free, learn:</p>

        <h2><a name="LawnGrassDiseaseIdentification"><span style="color: #000000;">How to Identify Common Fungal Lawn Diseases</span></a></h2>
        <p>In order for fungal diseases to strike, three factors must be in play: disease pathogens, weather conditions that favor disease development, and susceptible lawn grasses. Without all three factors present, grasses keep the upper hand. While you can't control the weather, you can recognize fungal threats, learn how to identify lawn and grass diseases, and take action.</p>
        <p>Active fungal disease usually occurs in times of stress, which vary according to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">grass growing regions</a>. For example, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EB81614ED373435A88A451F2FA909053&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">warm-season grasses</a>&nbsp;are hit when abnormally cool temperatures slow their growth; cool-season grasses are most vulnerable under warmer than normal conditions. Excessive rain, drought and overcast skies all impact your lawn's ability to fight back.</p>

        <h2><a name="TreatandPreventLawnDisease"><span style="color: #000000;">How to Treat and Prevent Lawn Diseases</span></a></h2>
        <p>Once you identify a lawn or grass disease, good lawn maintenance can help prevent and correct it. Prevention and prompt adjustments in lawn care at the first signs of trouble restore the advantage to your lawn. Keep your lawn at its competitive peak with these fungal-fighting practices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Keep soil pH at a level lawn grasses need</li>
            <li>Fertilize properly</li>
            <li>Water for lawn health, strength and resilience</li>
            <li>Choose premium, water-wise grass seed products</li>
            <li>Follow good mowing practices</li>
            <li>Dethatch lawns and aerate soil regularly</li>
            <li>Use pesticides for severe infestations</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Keep soil pH at a level lawn grasses need.</strong> Most lawn grasses prefer slightly acidic soil near 6.0 to 7.0 pH, where essential nutrients stay readily available. Regular <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">soil testing</a>&nbsp;and appropriate <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6042EC370E1449AEAE9BB1C58548626E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">soil amendments</a>&nbsp;help keep your grass healthy and strong.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Fertilize properly.</strong> Underfertilizing leaves grass undernourished, and overfertilizing promotes weak, rushed growth; both mistakes set up lawns for disease. Fertilize with premium products, such as those in the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=652C4491FD974B2AAFA7005ED29EA0ED&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington UltraGreen</a>&nbsp;line of lawn fertilizers, that release essential nutrients at the right levels. Follow label instructions for proper amounts.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Water for lawn health, strength and resilience.</strong> Irrigate early in morning when evaporation rates are low and the emerging sun speeds drying, reducing the amount of time grass spends wet. Don't water frequently; instead, water deeply, one to two times weekly, to encourage strong, deep, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FA7C95CF1EDA4B588571CA2211249D26&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">drought-tolerant</a>&nbsp;roots. Irrigation equal to 1 inch of precipitation soaks soil to a 4- to 6-inch depth, which is perfect for healthy, established grass. Don't leave irrigation on automatic. Adjust to accommodate rainfall or the lack of it.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Choose premium, water-wise grass seed products.</strong> Use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">grasses recommended for your region</a>&nbsp;and suited for your yard's sun exposure. The right grass is key to avoiding disease. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Smart Seed</a>&nbsp;grass seed saves up to 30 percent more water versus ordinary grass seed, reducing watering-related problems. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6393DC567BCC4CB4A89538A2A10EA28B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington One Step Complete</a>&nbsp;seeding mixture combines premium Smart Seed grass seed, professional-grade fertilizer and natural wood mulch in an easy-to-use, premixed product to establish resilient grass and correct problem areas.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Follow good mowing practices.</strong> <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Mow at heights recommended for your grass</a>&nbsp;type. Keep your mower blades sharp, and mow according to grass growth, not the calendar. Remove only one-third of the blade height in a single mowing. If you suspect fungal lawn disease, always collect and dispose of lawn clippings&mdash;don't compost them. Some diseases spread through clippings can infect your compost pile.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Dethatch lawns and aerate soil regularly.</strong> Thatch up to 1/2 inch thick acts like beneficial mulch, but amounts beyond that restrict water and air and encourage disease. Compacted soil does the same. Reduce compaction with regular aeration, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3D5EBDDD0F3647F18178255AD405847C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">dethatch your lawn</a>&nbsp;as needed so air, sun and moisture reach their goal and keep disease at bay.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Use pesticides for severe infestations.</strong> When corrections alone aren't sufficient, choose pesticides specifically approved for the disease at hand. <a href="https://www.mossout.com/all-products" target="_blank">Lilly Miller Moss Out! 5 in 1 Broadleaf Weed &amp; Moss Killer</a>, for example, controls lawn and grass diseases such as dollar spot, snow mold and rust. Most otherwise healthy lawns recover quickly with proper corrections. Many other lawn fungicides are only available to licensed applicators, so preventing problems is key.</p>
        <p>By recognizing conditions that promote fungal lawn diseases and learning to identify grass diseases, you can circumvent their threat and solve lawn disease problems promptly. With the help of Pennington grass seed and Pennington lawn health products, you can keep your lawn grasses lush, beautiful and beyond the reach of fungal disease.</p>
