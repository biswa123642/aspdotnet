        <h2>Caring for Bulbs Annually</h2>
        <p>Bulbs are low-maintenance, but they do require some attention to enable them to reach their full potential. As the soil begins to warm in the spring, remove mulch to allow the soil temperature to get warm enough to encourage growth. Allow the greens and flowers to grow undisturbed.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p>After the blooms begin to fade, fertilize with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=30B0FDFA8C024FE49E2AB0C279D87541&amp;_z=z">Alaska Morbloom Fertilizer 0-10-10</a>, which promotes vigorous root growth and colorful flowers. Once the blooms are spent, remove the flower heads but leave the green foliage.<sup>4</sup> While the foliage can be unattractive, it is necessary to leave it undisturbed as long as possible to allow the plant to store up food and energy for next year's bloom. Once the foliage begins to turn brown, remove the foliage by cutting the plant to the ground.</p>
        <p>Because bulbs multiply underground, the garden bed can get crowded, causing the flowers to not bloom as well. Dig up and divide bulbs every three to four years, or as needed, and replant or share the extra bulbs with friends.</p>
        <p>This autumn, get the whole family involved in your garden by choosing a beautiful day to plant spring bulbs before the ground freezes. Winter may be long, but by the time the cold weather departs, your patience and work will be rewarded with beautiful spring flowers.</p>
