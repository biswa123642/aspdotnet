        <p><em>&ldquo;I planted 8 acres of Mohawk Bermuda Grass on April 21, 2007.&nbsp; By May 12, the stand was up and covering the ground.&nbsp;I then fertilized the field on June 11, 2007 with 400 pounds of 19-19-19.&nbsp; From these 8 acres, I baled 56 4X5rolls on August 1, 2008.&nbsp; I fertilized again with 200 pounds of N after the first cutting.&nbsp; On October 13, I cut 577 square bales on the field.&nbsp; In 2008, I believe that I will get at least 4 cuttings and maybe 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stack my hay in the barn according to the variety and everyone goes right to the Mohawk because of its finer stem and leaf.&nbsp;&nbsp; My horse customers now want nothing but Mohawk.&nbsp; With Mohawk, I have found a hay product that is high in digestibility with excellent nutritive value.&nbsp; It establishes quicker than sprigged varieties and grows as tall as Costal and Giggs, but with a finer stem and leaf.&nbsp; I will use Mohawk again to renovate fields and establish new ones.&rdquo;</em></p>
