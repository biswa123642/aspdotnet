        <br /><strong>Is there a suggested protocol for planting seeded bermudagrass in fields with a history of weed<br />
        problems?</strong>
        <p>Competition from other grasses and weeds is the number one reason for bermudagrass stand failure.<br />
        Taking steps upfront to reduce this competition will increase your chance of successful establishment.<br />
        When planting in fields or paddocks with a history of weeds, don&rsquo;t get in a hurry to plant. If soil<br />
        temperature is not consistently 65○<br />
        For higher at a depth of 4&rdquo;, bermudagrass will not germinate. When the seed does germinate it will be weaker and more susceptible to competition. Prepare the seedbed well<br />
        in advance to allow the first flush of crabgrass and other weed and grass competition to emerge. Use a<br />
        non-selective, non-residual herbicide such as glyphosate to kill this flush of weeds before planting<br />
        seeded varieties of bermuda like Cheyenne II, Ranchero Frio or Mohawk. Once the bermuda becomes<br />
        established, there are several herbicides that can be used to control many weed species.</p>
        <p><strong>Are there management techniques that can help insure successful seeded bermudagrass stand<br />
        establishment?</strong><br />
        Yes. For quicker germination and more vigorous seedlings, seeded bermudagrass planting should be delayed<br />
        until late spring when soil temperatures have stabilized at 65 degrees or higher. After the bermuda germinates<br />
        and begins to tiller (develop runners), apply 30-40 lbs nitrogen/ac. Monitor broadleaf weed and summer annual<br />
        grass emergence. If broadleaf weeds become troublesome, a low dose (1-1&frac12; pts/A) of 2,4-D amine may be<br />
        applied when the bermuda begins to develop runners. If broadleaf weeds become a problem before runners<br />
        develop, mow the area as needed to reduce weed competition and shading of the seedling bermuda plants. Keep<br />
        annual grasses and johnsongrass periodically mowed until the bermuda is well established. Do not graze or<br />
        harvest for hay until the bermuda is 6-8&rdquo; or more in height. If harvested for hay, leave at least a 2.0&rdquo;&nbsp;- 2.5&rdquo; of<br />
        stubble height. Allow the bermuda to obtain a <strong>minimum</strong> of 3-4&rdquo; of re-growth prior to a killing frost.</p>
        <p><strong>Can a field planted in seeded bermudagrass in late spring or early summer be overseeded with<br />
        ryegrass in the fall?</strong><br />
        Pennington forage experts do not recommend overseeding newly established bermuda with winter<br />
        annuals or clover the fall following spring planting. Bermuda roots and stolons need time to establish<br />
        and mature prior to introducing competitive forages. In fact, if weather or other circumstances prevent<br />
        the bermuda from becoming fully established during year one, it may be necessary to delay overseeding<br />
        the field until the 3rd fall after planting.</p>
        <p><strong>Will Cheyenne II seeded-type forage bermudagrass revert back to common after only a few years<br />
        of growth?</strong><br />
        No. Cheyenne II is a certified, stable variety. It is not a mixture or blend of seed containing common<br />
        bermuda. As such, it remains as is; i.e. an excellent yielding, highly digestible, improved forage<br />
        bermudagrass year after year.</p>
        <p><strong>What management practices are necessary to keep a bermuda stand thick and productive?</strong><br />
        To begin, take a soil sample to determine soil pH, phosphorus and potassium levels. While bermudagrass is<br />
        considered a hardy and low maintenance forage, it cannot tolerate low soil fertility over long periods of time. To<br />
        cut costs, farmers often apply ample amounts of nitrogen but fail to maintain proper soil pH and adequate soil<br />
        levels of phosphorus and potassium. This leads to poor yields, plant decline and thinning stands. According to<br />
        forage specialists, for every ton of bermuda hay taken per acre, approximately 45 lbs. of nitrogen, 10 lbs. of<br />
        phosphorus and 48 lbs. of potash per acre are removed with it. Potassium is of particular importance because it<br />
        is a key component of cell wall structure giving the plant improved winter hardiness and disease resistance.<br />
        Potassium also increases rhizome and stolon production which allows bermuda stands to remain thick and<br />
        productive.</p>
