        <p>Water is essential for every living thing. Birds are more efficient at using it than most mammals, but many are drawn to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BEA6093B1254502AA0E0512C59778CF&amp;_z=z">birdbaths</a>, both for drinking and for bathing.</p>
        <p>Backyard fountains can be especially attractive to birds and people. Birds that live in your area may visit your birdbath regularly, but a much bigger variety may notice the activity of other birds or the sounds from the fountain as they’re migrating through, and may stop for a quick drink.</p>
        <br><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/Backyard-Birding-Tips-Birdbaths/carolina-chickadee-on-birdbath.jpg"/><br /><p>Set the birdbath where birds can quickly hide in a thick shrub or potted plant if a hawk passes through, or simply to perch while preening after the bath. Never set a birdbath anywhere where cats may lurk.</p>
        <p>Make sure you keep your birdbath clean. Remember this is a source of drinking water for them, but also that some birds bathe in the water, so it can get germy.</p>
        <br /><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/Backyard-Birding-Tips-Birdbaths/blue-jay-on-water-fountain.jpg"/><br /><p>Some of the most dangerous mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, including birdbaths. Changing the water every two or three days will prevent any mosquitoes from emerging.</p>
        <p>Algae eventually starts growing on birdbaths. Don&rsquo;t use algaecide or other toxins in the water, and pennies have dangerous levels of zinc. To prevent algae, use a stiff brush to vigorously wipe the birdbath when changing the water. If algae does start growing, you may need to soak the birdbath in a strong bleach solution after cleaning. Make sure you thoroughly rinse and dry it after this.</p>
