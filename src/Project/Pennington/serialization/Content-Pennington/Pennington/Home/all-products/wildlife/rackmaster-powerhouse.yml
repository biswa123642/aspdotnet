        RACKMASTER Powerhouse is a blend of high yielding perennial forage chicory and Pennington&rsquo;s widely used Durana perennial white clover &ndash; both of which can persist multiple years when properly managed. It is a high quality and protein packed forage mixture highly preferred by deer, turkey and other wildlife. With good management, this powerhouse combination can produce 2 to 3 tons or more of dry matter forage per acre annually, supplying abundant amounts of highly digestible, premium quality forage for deer and other wildlife throughout the spring and summer months and into fall. With protein levels of 25% and digestibility of 75% or more, Powerhouse helps maximize body and antler growth of bucks and optimize milk production for nursing does. It features Pennington&rsquo;s ultra-popular Durana white clover which is drought tolerant and annually captures up to 150 lbs. /acre nitrogen reducing the need for commercial nitrogen purchases while building organic matter and improving soil tilth. Chicory is also drought tolerant and uptakes an array of minerals from the soil into its leaves that are needed for good antler growth and deer herd health. Powerhouse can be planted alone or used in mixtures with other winter annual small grains. &nbsp;RACKMASTER Powerhouse features RapidResults seed germination enhancement technology which promotes quicker emergence and stronger, deeper root growth. The result is a hardier and more productive food plot.<br>

        <p><strong>USES:</strong></p>
        <p>To attract and provide nutrition for deer throughout the year. To furnish high quality nutrition for growing bucks and fawns, pregnant does, and does nursing fawns from spring throughout summer and into the fall.

        <p><strong>Planting:</strong><br /> <strong>Method:</strong> Choose a site that receives a minimum of 8 hours of full sun. Prepare a clean, smooth and firm seedbed by plowing and dragging the soil. Fertilizer and lime can be applied during this step to incorporate it into the soil. Plant with a drill on a firm seedbed or broadcast seed evenly across the soil surface and incorporate it using a culti-packer or light drag to cover the seed. Care should be taken to ensure seed are planted at the proper depth. &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Seeding Date</strong>: South - Sept. 15 thru Nov. 1; Upper South &ndash; Sept. 1 thru Oct. 15 and Mar. 15 thru May 1; North - Aug. 1 thru Sept. 15 and Apr. 1 thru May 15.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Seeding Rate:</strong> 10 lbs. per acre alone (4 oz. / 1000 sq. ft.) or 3-4 lbs. per acre in mixes (1.0 &ndash; 1.5 oz./1000 sq. ft.)<br /> <strong>Seeding Depth</strong>: &frac14; (stand failures will result from seed planted too shallow or too deep).<br /> <strong>Fertilizer</strong>: Soil testing is highly recommended. Liming to a pH of 6.0-7.0 and providing adequate amounts of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus fertilizer are necessary to ensure a productive RACKMASTER Powerhouse food plot. (Consult your local county extension office for soil sampling assistance.) Apply phosphorus and potassium per soil test recommendations. Apply 30-40 lbs. /acre (.75 -1.0 lb. /1000 sq. ft.) starter nitrogen. In the absence of a soil test, apply 200 lbs. /acre 19-19-19 (5 lbs. /1000 sq. ft.) or equivalent fertilizer and 1 ton/acre ag lime (50 lbs./1000 sq. ft.). Apply fertilizer just prior to seeding. If practical, apply lime a minimum of 3 months before planting. To obtain additional production, apply another 200 lbs./acre 19-19-19 fertilizer (5 lbs./1000 sq. ft.) 45-60 days after emergence.<br /> <strong>Inoculant: </strong>Durana clover seed come pre-inoculated with selected Rhizobia strains of bacteria for optimal root nodulation and nitrogen fixation.</p> <p><strong>Special Note:</strong> Aggressive volunteer winter annual forages such as ryegrass should be controlled/suppressed with appropriate herbicides to allow the clover and chicory to establish.</p> <p ><br /> <strong>Management:</strong><br /> RACKMASTER Powerhouse forage mixture is highly responsive to good soil fertility especially nitrogen fertilization. For maximum productivity and stand life, maintain a soil pH of 6.0 or higher and medium to high soil levels of phosphorus and potassium. Annual or biennial soil testing is highly recommended. Apply a total of *60 lbs. per acre (1.5 lbs. /1000 sq. ft.) nitrogen annually applying &frac12; in the spring and the remaining &frac12; in early fall. &nbsp;To keep chicory forage growth leafy and fresh, prevent seedhead formation by mowing plots periodically in the spring and summer months to remove developing flower stems.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: lighter;"><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: lighter;">*175 lbs./acre 34-0-0 or equivalent nitrogen fertilizer (4 lbs./1000 sq.ft.)</span></p> <p><strong>Tips for Successful Food Plots:</strong><br /> 1. Every successful food plot begins with a soil test. Most woodland soils have low pH and low fertility. A soil test will tell you how much fertilizer and lime is needed. Information on taking a soil test can be obtained from your local county extension office.<br /> 2. Spend the extra time necessary to properly prepare the soil by plowing, smoothing and firming the ground. Planting on a weed free, smooth and firm seedbed that allows good seed-soil contact is essential for a thick, productive forage stand.<br /> 3. Plant seed at the proper seeding depth. Planting too shallow or too deep can result in stand failure. Seed mixes containing small seeded legumes and forbs should not be seeded deeper than &frac14; inch. Use a cultipacker, log or a light drag to firm the soil after planting.<br /> 4. When selecting a wildlife food plot site, choose an area that is long and narrow with curves or bends in it. This provides a sense of comfort and safety for wildlife. When developing food plots, a good rule of thumb is to plant 2.5 to 7 acres of food plots for every 100 acres of habitat.<br /> 5. Avoid droughty sites such as eroded hillsides or shallow, rocky soils. Southwest facing slopes are hotter in the summer and tend to dry out faster than bottom land.&nbsp;<br /> 6. A minimum of 50% full sunshine is essential for a healthy and productive food plot. Morning sun is better than afternoon sun for summer game food plots. The reverse is generally true in the winter.</p> <div><br /> </div>
