        <p>Meeting plant needs starts with preparation. With the help of&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=113E1E75B92540AA911805EA6AB2B974&amp;_z=z">soil amendments</a>, which modify soil and its pH, you can provide the foundation plants need. Soil testing is the best place to start. An&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z">accurate soil sample</a>&nbsp;from your planting area yields information on soil pH and other keys&nbsp;for plant health and growth. Soil testing laboratories will also recommend how to amend your specific soil for acid-loving plants.</p>
        <p>If your soil pH is too high for this special group, you'll need to lower it to keep plants healthy. For&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6BE45590CD824B36B15DACBD22F6D512&amp;_z=z">homegrown blueberries</a>, for example, soil pH should be 4.5 to 5.5. Soil tests may recommend amendments such as elemental sulfur, which naturally lowers soil pH when mixed into soil, or an ammonium sulfate product, such as&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FC1EAE7C34D445B2950F17BF5499A6B8&amp;_z=z">Lilly Miller<sup> </sup>Ammonium Sulfate 21-0-0,</a>&nbsp;which feeds plants necessary nitrogen and lowers soil pH faster than elemental sulfur.</p>
        <p>Follow the soil test laboratory's recommendations for the type of amendment and the amount, so your blueberry bushes and other acid loving plants can access existing soil nutrients, as well as those you add through fertilizers. At lower pH levels, azaleas and rhododendrons sometimes need added calcium. Gypsum products, such as&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=31FE5A46FCF54B21B4730E9684B7B254&amp;_z=z">Pennington<sup> </sup>Fast Acting Gypsum</a>, may be prescribed to deliver calcium without changing soil pH, and to improve soil structure.</p>
