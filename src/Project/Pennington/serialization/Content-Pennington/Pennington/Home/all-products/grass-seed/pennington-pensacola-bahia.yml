        <p>Pensacola Bahiagrass is a low-maintenance grass bred for sunny coastal lawns. Known for its durability through both hot summers and cold winters, Pennington Pensacola Bahiagrass thrives even in poor soil conditions.</p>
        <p>This sun and drought tolerant grass thrives in lawns that receive eight or more hours of sun. Plant it in the early spring and start to see results within 7 to 21 days. This 3-pound bag covers up to 600 square feet for overseeding an existing lawn and 300 square feet for starting a new lawn from scratch.</p>
        <p>While most grass seed companies buy their seed on the open market, we are the only major grass seed company that works directly with a network of dedicated growers. Built on decades of trust and integrity, our relationships with seed growers and their families now span multiple generations. Our legacy of working directly with farmers to bring you the finest grass seed possible helps ensure their success and ours. At Pennington, we know our seed and the farmers who grow it. From field to final product, that's the Pennington way. </p>
