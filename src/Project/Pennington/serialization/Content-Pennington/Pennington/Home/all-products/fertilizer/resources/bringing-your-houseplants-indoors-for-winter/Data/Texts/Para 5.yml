        <h2>TransitionHouseplantsOutdoorsNextSpring</h2>
        <p>When temperatures remain above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at night in spring, it's safe to transition your houseplants outdoors. Start by placing them next to the house in a shaded area, and then gradually move them to brighter locations over the course of five to seven days. Avoid putting houseplants in a final location that gets full sun, as such light is often too harsh and will burn foliage. A location that gets morning sun or dappled sunlight is generally best. With the first spring watering outdoors, once again apply Pennington Ultragreen Plant Starter with B1 and Lilly Miller All Purpose Planting &amp; Growing Food 10-10-10.</p>
