        <br /><p>White millet, also known as proso millet or white proso millet, is a favorite with birds including quail, migratory native American sparrows, doves, towhees, juncos, and cardinals.</p>
        <p>So many of the birds drawn to millet are ground-feeding species, so birders have their best luck offering it directly on the ground (near cover, such as shrubs or a brush pile) or on a low platform feeder.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/White-Millet-for-Ground-feeding-Birds/northern_cardinal_ground.jpg"/><br /><em>Northern Cardinal</em><br /><p>Avoid putting pure white millet in tube feeders—a few birds may come, but most of the birds that eat it won’t even realize such a delicious meal could possibly be found in such an alien structure. Millet mixed with sunflower seeds, as in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B5E88C5D91804535B7CE33ACD900A1A6&amp;_z=z">Pennington Select Birder’s Blend</a>, can increase the number of species that visit your backyard.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/White-Millet-for-Ground-feeding-Birds/white-throated_sparrow.jpg"/><br /><em>White-throated Sparrow</em><br /><p>Birders who try to pump up the list of birds they see in their yards often scatter millet along the edge of a hedge or brush pile, especially during spring and fall. This will attract a wide variety of migrating birds. Most will belong to species that are common in your area, but when you search among them, you can pick out rarer ones.</p>
        <p>As with any seed, when millet gets wet it germinates, and also can foster bacteria and fungal growth. So never scatter more than birds can eat in a day or two, and make sure that tray or platform feeders have excellent drainage.</p>
