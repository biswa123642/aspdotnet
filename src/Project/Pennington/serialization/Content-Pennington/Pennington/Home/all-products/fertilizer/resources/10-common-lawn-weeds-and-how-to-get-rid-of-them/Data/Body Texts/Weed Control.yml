        <h2>Weed-Control Options</h2>
        When choosing weed-control products, take into consideration your target weeds, whether they’re still seeds or emerged plants, and the type of lawn grass you grow. Different types of weeds call for different controls, and some Southern lawn grasses, such as St. Augustinegrass and Centipedegrass, are sensitive to some weed-control products. Always check the label to make sure the product you choose is suitable for your lawn grass.&nbsp;<br />
        <p>A top-notch weed-management program involves the following types of weed control products*:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crabgrass Preventers:</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> Crabgrass plants die after setting their seeds, but their seeds live on. Germination starts in spring, once soil temperatures reach approximately 55 degrees Fahrenheit – the same temperature that sends forsythia shrubs into bloom. Proper weed management works to stop those seeds from germinating and rid your lawn of any that sneak through. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4D628DBF106E4CADA70CF4EB800FAFC1&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen<sup> </sup>Crabgrass Preventer Plus Fertilizer III 30-0-4</a>&nbsp;inhibits germination and root development of crabgrass and stops many weed grasses and broadleaf weed seeds when applied in early spring, before weed seeds germinate. While controlling weeds for three to five months, this nitrogen-rich product continues to feed your lawn. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4D628DBF106E4CADA70CF4EB800FAFC1&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen Crabgrass Preventer Plus Fertilizer III 30-0-4</a>&nbsp;prevents crabgrass germination, suppresses other weed grass and broadleaf weed seeds and controls weed grass for three to five months while feeding your lawn with slow-release nitrogen.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weed &amp; Feed Fertilizers:</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> As the name implies, weed &amp; feed products tackle common lawn weeds while feeding lawn grasses to better help them act against weed invasion. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9825BB355F154A2E891B819CB73AA765&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen Weed &amp; Feed 30-0-4</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A285E790947343318DDD6E2598B88EFD&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen<sup> </sup>Southern Weed &amp; Feed 34-0-4</a>, both safe on Centipedegrass and St. Augustinegrass lawns, kill and suppress tough existing broadleaf weeds and control new weeds for up to three months in established lawns. Applied when weeds are actively growing in late spring and early summer, and again in early fall, these weed &amp; feed products continue to feed your lawn grass and keep it beautiful and green.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Targeted Weed Control:</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> When existing perennial weeds continue to be a problem, or when new weed seeds germinate and seedlings emerge, a targeted post-emergent herbicide is the answer. For best results, treat weeds while they’re small and actively growing throughout the season. <a href="https://www.imageforweeds.com/all-products/all-in-one" target="_blank">IMAGE All-in-One Weed Killer</a>&nbsp;herbicide offers a broad spectrum of selective weed control for difficult sedges, crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, killing weed roots, shoots and nutlets. These weed killers target weeds only and are suitable for most cool- and warm-season lawn grasses. <a href="https://www.imageforweeds.com/all-products/kills-nutsedge" target="_blank">IMAGE Kills Nutsedge</a> and <a href="https://www.imageforweeds.com/all-products/st-augustine-grass" target="_blank">IMAGE Herbicide for St. Augustinegrass and Centipedegrass</a> provide targeted, selective control of tenacious, emerged weeds.</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Well maintained lawns naturally control weeds.</h2>
        Keeping your lawn grass healthy and competitive provides the best defense against lawn weed invasions. Follow these four steps to a healthier, stronger lawn:<br />
        <br />
        1. Always mow at the recommended mowing height for your type of lawn grass. This helps promote healthy root growth and increases resistance to pests and disease.<br />
        <br />
        2. Mow based on grass growth, not your calendar. Time your mowing so you remove roughly one-third of the length of the grass blades in a single mowing.<br />
        <br />
        3. Supplement natural rainfall by irrigating your lawn as needed. Proper watering provides an average lawn with the equivalent of about 1 inch of rainfall each week. This allows moisture to penetrate deeply and encourages healthy, deep root growth. Watering only once or twice per week is better than more frequent watering.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        4. Keep your lawn well-fed with quality weed &amp; feed or fertilizer-only products, such as the Pennington UltraGreen line of lawn fertilizers.<br />
        <br />
        *Always consult the product label for your specific lawn grass type before using any type of weed control products.<br />
