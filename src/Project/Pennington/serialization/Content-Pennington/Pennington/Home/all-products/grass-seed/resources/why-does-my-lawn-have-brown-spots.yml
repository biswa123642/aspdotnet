You can take care of brown lawn spots and have them disappear as fast as they came. Reclaiming your lawn starts with a little detective work to determine who or what is to blame:<br />

Patches of yellow dying grass and brown dead grass usually peak in spring and fall. Grubs are the larval stage of <a href="https://gardentech.com/insects/scarab-beetles" target="_blank">beetles</a>, including <a href="https://gardentech.com/blog/pest-id-and-prevention/get-the-upper-hand-on-japanese-beetles" target="_blank">Japanese beetles</a>, which continue garden destruction as adults. Grub-damaged brown spots feel spongy underfoot. With heavy infestations, damaged sod rolls back like a rug. You'll see severed grass roots and soft, plump gray-white grubs curled into C-shapes about 1 inch long. You may also find your lawn disrupted by skunks, raccoons, birds and other critters after grub meals.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/why-does-my-lawn-have-brown-spots/chinch-bug.jpg" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Spot-causing chinch bugs are easily recognizable.<br />

Unable to take up water or nutrients, grass dies &mdash; and leaves brown lawn spots behind. Chinch bug damage is often mistaken for drought during hot summer weather, but irrigation won't bring grass back. Chinch bugs are less than 1/4 inch long, but a magnifying glass helps track them down in your lawn's thatch layer. You can't mistake the distinctive black-and-white hourglass shape on chinch bug backs.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/why-does-my-lawn-have-brown-spots/billbug.jpg" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Billbugs have long, bill-like snouts.<br />

You'll recognize these brown or black weevils by their long, curved snouts. Adult billbugs lay eggs inside grass blades; hatching larvae eat their way out. Brown lawn spots appear in early summer and spread, and are often mistaken for drought. Tug on billbug-infested grass and it breaks off at the base. Powdery excrement that looks like sawdust gives them away. Get a closer look at roots and you'll find grub-like larvae. Unlike beetle grubs, billbug larvae are legless.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/why-does-my-lawn-have-brown-spots/mole-cricket.jpg" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Mole crickets damage grass by tunneling and eating roots.</em></p><br /><h2><a name="MoleCrickets">Mole Crickets</a></h2><br />Early spring brings plenty of <a href="https://gardentech.com/insects/mole-crickets" target="_blank">mole cricket </a>activity, but damage peaks during summer. Like moles, mole crickets damage grass by tunneling and disrupting grass roots. Some feed on roots and shoots, too. In late summer and fall, spots of dead brown grass appear. Mole crickets are memorable: Their cricket-like bodies have crustacean-like heads and mole-like claws. If you see adult mole crickets in your yard in spring, their nymph offspring will bring brown lawn spots by fall.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/why-does-my-lawn-have-brown-spots/brown-patch.jpg" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lax lawn care can set grass up for fungal diseases and brown spots.<br />
