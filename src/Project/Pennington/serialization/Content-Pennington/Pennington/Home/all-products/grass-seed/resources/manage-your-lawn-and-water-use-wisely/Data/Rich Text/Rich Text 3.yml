        <h2>Responding to Drought and Water Restrictions</h2>
        <p>In drought-impacted areas, limited water and water restrictions demand stricter approaches to lawn care. Even in areas not officially under drought, it makes water-wise sense to look ahead and be prepared. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that nearly 50% of the United States was experiencing abnormally dry to extreme drought conditions as of September 1, 2015.<sup>5</sup></p>
