Uses: scavenge excess N, prevent erosion, add&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">organic matter, suppress weeds, forage.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Wheat </strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;">– Versatile and widely adapted cool season cereal grain; Upright growing; Good cold&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">tolerance; Easier to terminate than rye or barley; Slower to mature than other cereal grains;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Excellent soil builder; Improves soil tilth. Uses: prevent erosion, build organic matter, suppress&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">weeds, scavenge nutrients, forage.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Triticale</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> – A cool season cereal grain cross of wheat and rye; Cold tolerant and adapted to poor&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">soil sites; Early maturing; Good biomass production;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">&nbsp;Uses: prevent erosion, build organic matter,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">suppress weeds, scavenge nitrogen, build soil, forage.</span></li>
