        <p>Moss controls based on the active ingredient zinc sulfate monohydrate are particularly tough on structural mosses that thrive on roofs and buildings. Non-staining zinc sulfate products, such as the micro-granule Lilly Miller Moss Out! for Roofs and Structures Dry Formula and <a href="https://www.mossout.com/all-products/corrys-moss-b-ware-shaker" target="_blank">CORRY'S Moss B Ware</a>&nbsp;products, can be used wet or dry on roofs, patios, sidewalks, bricks and unpainted cement, and won't corrode galvanized gutters. These highly effective controls attach to proteins and organic acids in moss to disrupt growth, injure cell walls and cause moss to dry and die.<sup>2</sup> Moss is killed over a three- to five-week period, depending on moss thickness and conditions, but these products also help prevent future moss growth. Oregon State University reports that zinc sulfate moss killers, applied in powder form, have been known to provide effective moss control for up to two years under some circumstances.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <h2><a name="WhentoTreatExistingStructuralMoss">When to Treat Existing Structural Moss</a></h2>
        <p>Treating existing moss and taking preventive measures incorporate easily into normal fall or spring cleaning regimens. Effective products have the greatest impact when moss is actively growing during the cool, wet, rainy seasons of spring and fall &mdash; and winter, in some moderate climates. Mosses are largely dormant during warm, summer weather.</p>
        <p>Achieve maximum results by treating during moss's active season, but when no rainfall is expected for several days. This hits moss at its most vulnerable, without rain to rehydrate its tissues or wash treatments away. For heavy, thick moss, remove as much as possible prior to treatment or the thick layer acts as an umbrella and protects the moss beneath. Always check your product's label for the surface you're treating, before applying the product.</p>
