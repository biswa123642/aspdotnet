        <br /><p>Root rot is a condition that, if left untreated, will kill plants. Because the first symptoms of root rot occur beneath the soil, gardeners are often not aware of the problem until it is advanced. When plants start showing symptoms of root rot, such as yellow leaves or stunted growth<sup>1</sup>, take action immediately to resolve the problem.</p>
        <p>Plants in soils too dense for water to drain out efficiently, or in containers that lack sufficient drainage holes, are most susceptible to root rot. While container plants are most at risk, garden plants are not immune to root rot. Most garden root rot issues can be prevented by taking steps to improve soil drainage before planting.<sup>2</sup> While it may seem like excessive water is the cause of root rot, the problem starts because too much water provides the perfect environment for the real cause: fungus.</p>
        
        <h2>Identifying Root Rot</h2>
        <p>Root rot can be identified by the presence of soft, brown roots.<sup>2</sup> The root system of a healthy plant should be firm and white. But when soil is soggy, fungal spores multiply and the fungus starts to spread<sup>3</sup>, developing in the extremities of the roots first. As the fungus advances, healthy portions of root turn brown and mushy as the roots die. The plant is then unable to absorb the nutrients it needs, and that deficiency becomes apparent in the condition of plant foliage. Leaves begin to wilt and turn yellow or fall off, growth slows, and blooming may be delayed.<sup>1</sup> In the most extreme cases, when conditions are ideal for the fungus to spread quickly, plants can die within 10 days.<sup>3</sup> If these symptoms occur in a plant, loosen the soil around the base of the plant with a hand trowel or shovel and remove the plant from the soil. Gently shake the soil from the roots and inspect them for rot.</p>
        
        <h2>Dealing with Root Rot</h2>
        
        <p>Once root rot is identified, you must determine if the plant can be saved. If the entire root system has already become mushy, it is too late to save the plant. However, if some healthy, white, firm roots exist, try to bring the plant back to good health by replanting in fresh soil with good drainage.</p>
        <p>Prepare plants for replanting by cleaning the roots gently under running water and removing all brown, mushy roots with a sharp pair of scissors. Cut the healthy root just above the damaged area. Work quickly to replant within a few hours. After all roots are pruned, sterilize the scissors with a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water<sup>4</sup> to avoid spreading fungal spores to other plants or soil.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/fertilizer/Recovering-from-Root-Rot/BucketPlant_RootRot.jpg"/><br /><p>Root rot is a condition that, if left untreated, will kill plants.
