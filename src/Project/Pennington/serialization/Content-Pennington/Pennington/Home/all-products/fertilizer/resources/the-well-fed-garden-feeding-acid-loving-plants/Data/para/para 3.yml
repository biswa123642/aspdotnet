        <h2>Recognizing Signs of Trouble</h2>
        
        <p>When alkaline soil shuts down an acid-loving plant's access to needed nutrients, the leaves soon tell the tale. In a condition known as chlorosis, leaves turn pale green or yellow. In acid-loving plants, a lack of iron or magnesium is often the cause. Unless these pH-induced deficiencies are corrected, leaves and branches suffer and plant health fails.</p>
        <p>Nutrients vary in the way they move through plants, so patterns of chlorosis vary in predictable ways. With nitrogen deficiencies, old and new leaves take on a uniform, pale appearance. But with iron deficiency, the leaves turn yellow between the small leaf veins. The veins themselves stay green, and the youngest leaves are affected first. With a magnesium deficiency, the yellowing starts at the outer tip and edges, leaving green along the center vein and base; the oldest leaves are hardest hit.</p>
