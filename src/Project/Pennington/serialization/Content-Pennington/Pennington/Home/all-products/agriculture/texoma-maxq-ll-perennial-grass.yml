        Released in 2011, Texoma MaxQ II is Pennington&rsquo;s next generation of non-toxic, novel endophyte- infected tall fescue. It offers higher yields and greater grazing persistence than many older and more recently released varieties of tall fescue, particularly in the South Central areas of the U.S. Extensive research and on-farm experience have shown animals grazing Texoma MaxQ II to have significantly greater gains, higher conception rates, and better overall health than those grazing toxic tall fescue varieties. Proven safe for all classes of horses including pregnant mares.
        <ul>
            <li>The first non-toxic endophyte infected tall fescue variety developed by the Noble Foundation for the Central and South-Central U.S.</li>
            <li>Can produce up to twice the pounds of beef per acre compared to toxic Kentucky 31</li>
            <li>Superior performer throughout the Fescue Belt &ndash; high yields and excellent persistence</li>
            <li>Superior performer in TX, OK, AR, LA, and MS</li>
            <li>Excellent seedling vigor and rust resistance</li>

        <strong>PLANTING:</strong><br /> For best result and maximum benefit, all toxic tall fescue and troublesome annual grasses including cheatgrass, rescue grass and unwanted ryegrass should be killed prior to the blooming stage before establishing Texoma MaxQ II (Consult the MaxQ Planting Guides (<a href="https://www.pennington.com/-/media/Files/Pennington-NA/US/product-literature/MaxQ_Spring_Establishment_Rev2.pdf?la=en">Spring </a>or <a href="https://www.pennington.com/-/media/Files/Pennington-NA/US/product-literature/MaxQ_Fall_Establishment.pdf?la=en" target="_blank">Fall </a>Planting) under the Agriculture Resources tab on the Pennington forage website for details.) A firm seedbed is important for good stand establishment. Seed can be drilled into a prepared, firm seedbed, no-tilled into killed sod with a no-till drill or surface broadcasted onto a prepared seed bed and packed in with a culti-packer.<br /> <strong>Rate:</strong> 15- 20 lbs/acre in a prepared seedbed or 20-25 lbs/acre sod-seeded in stubble.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Depth:</strong> &nbsp;1/4" to 1/2". Planting too deep can result in poor stand emergence.<br /> <strong>Dates:</strong> <em>Southern and Southeastern states:</em> Sept.15 to Nov.1; <em>South Central U.S.:</em> Oct. 1 to Nov. 15;<em> Mid-South, Midwest and Northeastern states:</em> Aug. 15 to Oct. 1 or spring planted in March and April. <br /> <strong>Fertilization:&nbsp;</strong>Lime to a pH of 6.0 - 6.5. Apply phosphorus and potassium according to soil tests. Use 25 - 35 lbs/A starter nitrogen. <p> <strong>Management:</strong> &nbsp;Do not graze or cut seedling stand until it reaches 6"-8" tall. During the year after establishment, rest fescue pastures during the summer months. If weather conditions are favorable for growth, forage may be used for light rotational grazing for short periods or harvested for hay. Leave 3 - 4&rdquo; of forage growth after grazing or haying. To prevent hoof pugging damage, do not graze when soil is excessively wet and soft.<br /> <br /> <strong>GENERAL MANAGEMENT:</strong><br /> For maximum productivity and stand life in grazed pastures, use a rotational grazing system. Apply N, P &amp; K fertilizer annually as recommended by a soil test. Apply nitrogen in early fall and in late winter. Keep forage fresh and leafy by grazing or periodic clipping. Rotate cattle between pastures more often during periods of heat and drought stress. Forage may be stockpiled during periods of rapid growth in early fall and utilized for winter grazing. To prevent contamination, do not feed toxic fescue hay in MaxQ II pastures.</p>
