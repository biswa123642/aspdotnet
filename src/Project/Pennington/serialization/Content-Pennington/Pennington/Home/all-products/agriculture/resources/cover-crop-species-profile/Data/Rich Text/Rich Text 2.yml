        <strong>Brassicas</strong><br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rape</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> – Combines rapid fall growth and high biomass production with excellent nutrient scavenging&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">capability; Has shown to have biological activity against both parasitic nematodes and certain&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">weeds; Scavenges 75-125 lbs/A nitrogen. Uses: erosion prevention, nutrient scavenging, suppression&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">of weeds and soil-borne insects, soil organic matter and tilth improvement.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Mustard </strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;">– Combines rapid fall growth and high biomass production with excellent nutrient&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">scavenging capability; Has shown to have biological activity against certain soil-borne insects and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">pathogens as well as some weeds; Readily subject to winter kills. Uses: erosion prevention, nutrient&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">scavenging, suppression of weeds and soil-borne insects and pathogens, soil organic matter and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">tilth improvement.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Radish </strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;">– Combines rapid fall growth and high biomass production with excellent nutrient&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">scavenging capability; Oilseed and forage types; Attainable biomass amounts of up to 4 tons per&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">acre above ground and 2 tons per&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">acre below ground; Large roots penetrate deep into the soil profile to reduce compaction, capture&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">nutrients and improve water infiltration. Uses: prevent erosion, scavenge nutrients, suppress&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">weeds, reduce soil compaction, add organic matter, improve soil tilth and water penetration.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Turnips</strong><span style="font-weight: lighter;"> – Combines rapid fall growth and good biomass production with excellent nutrient&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">scavenging capability; Not as productive as other brassica species; Large roots penetrate deep into&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">the soil to reduce compaction, capture nutrients and improve water infiltration. Uses: prevent&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">erosion&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">weeds, reduce soil compaction, add organic&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">matter, improve soil tilth and water penetration, forage.</span></li>
