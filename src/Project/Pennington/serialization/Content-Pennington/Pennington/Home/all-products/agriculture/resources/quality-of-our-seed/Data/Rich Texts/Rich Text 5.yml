        <strong>ARG - 1 Annual Ryegrass</strong>
        <p>ARG-1 was selected for extended root growth to penetrate deeper into the soil profile to capture and hold excess nutrients. ARG-1 is a uniformly late maturing variety allowing for a longer termination window if spring conditions delay seeding of the summer crop. ARG-1 also makes excellent grazing, hay or silage for livestock with high digestibility, good crude protein levels and excellent palatability.</p>
        <strong>Nutrient Scavenger</strong>
        <p>ARG-1 is a heavy nitrogen user and its deeper root system will capture large amounts of excess nitrogen unused by the previous cash crop and made available to the next cash crop.</p>
