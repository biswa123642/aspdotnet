        <p>When it comes to turf, what happens above ground reflects what's going on underneath. Take <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB8C6D3391424C72827F93A69D880A4C&amp;_z=z">advice from lawn pros</a>&nbsp;and test your soil, so you know your starting point for essentials such as soil pH. Your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local county extension office</a>&nbsp;or agricultural agent will have information on test kits and reputable soil laboratories.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z">take accurate soil samples</a>&nbsp;yourself. Include separate samples for problem spots, such as bare areas or sections with <a href="https://www.mossout.com/killing-moss-tips/how-to-kill-lawn-moss-and-keep-it-gone" target="_blank">unwanted lawn moss</a>. Let the lab know you're testing lawn areas; they can tailor recommendations to get your lawn on track for your plans.</p>

        <p>With test results in hand, turn recommendations into projects. Correct problems now; don't risk repeats. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=113E1E75B92540AA911805EA6AB2B974&amp;_z=z">Use soil amendments</a>&nbsp;according to lab recommendations to improve your lawn's potential. Lime, for example, restores balance to soil pH so grasses can draw on available nutrients.</p>

Just like garden flowers or shrubs, turfgrasses vary in their climate preferences and tolerances for drought, shade and other conditions.

        <h2><a name="FeedYourGrassesWell"><span style="color: #000000;">Feed Your Grasses Well</span></a></h2>
        <p>Lawn grasses need proper nutrition. Nitrogen is especially important to keep your lawn lush, vibrant and green. Your soil test results will recommend how many pounds of nitrogen your lawn needs annually (usually per 1,000 square feet), based on its organic matter and other considerations.</p>
        <p>The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=98DA91B1C2114CBFA3D40E4F836434FF&amp;_z=z">numbers on fertilizer labels</a>&nbsp;reveal the percentages of actual nitrogen and other nutrients products contain, so you can match the product to your needs. Be careful, though: feeding too much or too often causes more harm than good. Establish a feeding schedule that meets <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=205E7E70E3F849C2BA7E490D41317996&amp;_z=z">your lawn's fertilizer needs</a>, and stick to it.</p>
        <h2><a name="Fight Lawn Weeds"><span style="color: #000000;">Fight Lawn Weeds</span></a></h2>
        <p>Even when freshly planted, lawns usually inherit weeds and weed seeds. Weeds compete with grasses for nutrients, water and light. Learn about <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z">common lawn weeds</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=91259B678503496FA443889A1B119951&amp;_z=z">how to kill broadleaf weeds,</a>&nbsp;so you eliminate the labor and expense of repeated treatments.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Your-First-Lawn--Start-Here/dandilion.jpg" /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: lighter;">One lawn weed can quickly turn to more.</em></div>
        <p>Avoid pre-emergent weed controls, such as crabgrass preventers, and combination weed-and-feed fertilizers anywhere you're planting new grass seed. These products are designed to keep weed seeds from germinating and rooting properly, but they can work against grass seed in the same way. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CC57A473BC104F6A8C53C3297C320C3E&amp;_z=z">Target tough turf weeds</a>&nbsp;with effective spot treatments.</p>
        <h2><a name="MowforHeightandHealth"><span style="color: #000000;">Mow for Height and Health</span></a></h2>
        <p>Always follow <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z">best practices for lawn mowing</a>, and mow based on grass growth, not day of the week. Mowing heights vary according to grass type and the season. Some grasses, such as Bermudagrass, are best kept short, while other types need more height. Hot spells warrant higher mowing heights all around.</p>
        <p>Change mowing heights gradually over several sessions. Never remove more than one-third of the blade length at a time, or you risk inhibiting good growth above and below ground. Make tasks easier and less time-consuming by using the<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=28DE422F58A44408B5C99AD451DD8A45&amp;_z=z"> right turf tools for the job</a>, based on your lawn's size and your goals.</p>
        <h2><a name="ManageWaterWisely"><span style="color: #000000;">Manage Water Wisely</span></a></h2>
        <p>Lawn grasses grow best when watered deeply at less frequent intervals. Shallow, frequent watering encourages shallow roots susceptible to drought and other stress. With <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FA7C95CF1EDA4B588571CA2211249D26&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">good watering practices</a>&nbsp;and water-conserving grass varieties, you can reduce consumption, save on bills and grow healthier, more resilient grass. Water Star® grasses, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington® Smart Seed® varieties</a>, require up to 30 percent less water than ordinary grass seed, year after year.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Your-First-Lawn--Start-Here/lawnmower.jpg" /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: lighter;">Water-conserving grasses help reduce water use and bills.</em></div>
        <p>Watering and other lawn tasks naturally vary from month to month through your seasonal lawn care calendar, but you should always accommodate what's happening in your lawn. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EF4854612E644CA6990C0C1832390434&amp;_z=z">Pennington's water rate calculator</a>&nbsp;uses real-time weather and statistics for your specific location to help determine water needs during normal seasons and times of drought.</p>
