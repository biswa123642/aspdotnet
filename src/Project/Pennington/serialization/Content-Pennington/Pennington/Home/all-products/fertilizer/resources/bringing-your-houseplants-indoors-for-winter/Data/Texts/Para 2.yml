        <h2>1. <a name="PrepareYourIndoorGrowingArea">Prepare Your Indoor Growing Area</a></h2>
        <p>Maintaining healthy plants indoors requires that you provide them with ideal growing conditions. Prior to transitioning your houseplants, ensure that they will receive adequate light by cleaning nearby windows. If conditions are too dim, invest in full-spectrum bulbs, which come in various sizes and can be used in standard light fixtures. Also stock up on the tools and supplies you'll need during the winter months, such as pruners, containers, potting soil, stakes and ties, a watering can and fertilizer.</p>
        <h2>2. <a name="InspectYourHouseplants">Inspect Your Houseplants</a></h2>
        <p>Before you transition your houseplants indoors, inspect them for signs of pests. When troublemakers, such as mealy bugs, enter a warm, protected indoor environment, they multiply rapidly and can quickly devour your indoor garden.</p>
        <p>To perform a thorough pest inspection of your houseplants, use a magnifying glass to look closely at the top and bottom of foliage, and between the whorls of leaves that are just beginning to unfurl. Also check the soil surface.</p>
