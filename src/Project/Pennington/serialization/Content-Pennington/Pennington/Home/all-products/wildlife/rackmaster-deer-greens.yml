        <p>RACKMASTER Deer Greens is a 100% mixture of brassicas including rape, purple top turnip, kale and Trophy Radish that provides an abundant high protein and energy rich diet for deer. It germinates quickly to provide an immediate high protein food source to help fill seasonal nutritional gaps. As winter sets in, carbohydrates contained in the leaves of the Deer Greens ingredients are converted to sugars providing a highly palatable source of energy during the colder months following the rut. After the leaves are consumed, deer continue to consume valuable nutrients by browsing on the large roots formed by the radish and turnip plants. Deer Greens can be mixed at a seeding rate of 1 - 2 lbs. per acre with winter annual grasses and clover to speed food plot establishment and enhance deer attraction. It may also be planted in late winter/early spring to provide a green leafy food source in the late spring and early summer months. &nbsp;RACKMASTER Deer Greens features RapidResults seed germination enhancement technology which promotes quicker emergence and stronger, deeper root growth. The result is a hardier and more productive food plot.</p>
        <p><strong>USES:</strong></p>
        <p>To attract and provide nutrition for deer. To furnish a high quality food source for post-rut bucks and pregnant does. In a mixture with winter annual grasses and clover to speed food plot establishment and enhance deer attraction.</p>

      Value: "<p><strong>Planting:</strong><br /> <strong>Method:</strong> Choose a site that receives a minimum of 8 hours of full sun. Prepare a clean, smooth and firm seedbed by plowing and dragging the soil. Fertilizer and lime can be applied during this step to incorporate it into the soil. Broadcast seed evenly across the soil surface and use a culti-packer or light drag to cover the seed. Making good seed/soil contact is the key to establishing a productive food plot.<br /> <strong>Seeding Date:</strong> South - Sept. 15 thru Nov. 1 and Jan. 15 thru Mar. 15; Upper South - Aug. 15 thru Oct. 1 and Mar. 15 thru May 1; North - Aug. 1 thru Sept. 1 and Apr. 1 thru May 15.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Seeding Rate:</strong> 10 lbs. per acre or &frac14; lb. per 1000 sq. ft.<br /> <strong>Seeding Depth:</strong> 1/4&rdquo; (stand failures will result from seed planted too shallow or too deep).<br /> <strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Soil testing is highly recommended. Liming to a pH of 6.0 - 6.5 and providing adequate levels of potassium and phosphorus are necessary to ensure a productive food plot. See your local county extension office for soil sampling assistance. In the absence of a soil test, apply 300 lbs. /acre 19-19-19 (7 lbs./1000 sq. ft.) or equivalent fertilizer and 1 ton/acre ag lime (50 lbs./1000 sq. ft.). Apply fertilizer just prior to seeding. If practical, apply lime a minimum of 3 months before planting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <p><strong>Management:</strong><br /> To obtain maximum production, apply an additional 30 &ndash; 50 lbs. /acre nitrogen 30 &ndash; 60 days after emergence with the application of 100 &ndash; 150 lbs./acre 34-0-0 (or equivalent) nitrogen fertilizer.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p> <p><strong>Tips for Successful Food Plots:</strong><br /> 1. Every successful food plot begins with a soil test. Most woodland soils have low pH and low fertility. A soil test will tell you how much fertilizer and lime is needed. Information on taking a soil test can be obtained from your local county extension office.<br /> 2. Spend the extra time necessary to properly prepare the soil by plowing, smoothing and firming the ground. Planting on a weed free, smooth and firm seedbed that allows good seed-soil contact is essential for a thick, productive forage stand.<br /> 3. Plant seed at the proper seeding depth. Planting too shallow or too deep can result in stand failure. Seed mixes containing small seeded legumes and forbs should not be seeded deeper than &frac14; inch. Use a cultipacker, log or a light drag to firm the soil after planting.<br /> 4. When selecting a wildlife food plot site, choose an area that is long and narrow with curves or bends in it. This provides a sense of comfort and safety for wildlife. When developing food plots, a good rule of thumb is to plant 2.5 to 7 acres of food plots for every 100 acres of habitat.<br /> 5. Avoid droughty sites such as eroded hillsides or shallow, rocky soils. Southwest facing slopes are hotter in the summer and tend to dry out faster than bottom land.&nbsp;<br /> 6. A minimum of 50% full sunshine is essential for a healthy and productive food plot. Morning sun is better than afternoon sun for summer game food plots. The reverse is generally true in the winter.</p>"
