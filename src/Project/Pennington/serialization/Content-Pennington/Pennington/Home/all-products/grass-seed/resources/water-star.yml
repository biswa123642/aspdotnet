        <br /><p><strong>Why Water Star qualified grass seed?</strong></p>
        <p>Water conservation is important as the demand for water rises, causing concern for depleting resources. The use of water is often criticized for "nonessential" applications, like maintaining residential lawns and other non-agricultural uses. To combat this growing concern, it's imperative that researchers work to introduce grasses that can survive under reduced or limited water, while maintaining overall plant health.Pennington Seed developed the Water Star qualifications to identify &mdash; and cultivate &mdash; grass which provides true water conservation benefits.Consumers can rest assured that any Pennington grass seed product bearing the Water Star logo has been through rigorous testing by the Turfgrass Water Conservation Alliance (TWCA) to meet the most stringent set of criteria.</p>
        <p><strong>How is Water Star developed?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Before grass can meet the Water Star Qualified Grass Seed standards, the Turfgrass Water Conservation Alliance conducts studies in approved structures, also known as rain out shelters, that restrict natural rainfall on the test plot area.This drought-stress period is replicated for two years in one location and evaluated two times weekly using digital image analysis (DIA) techniques. DIA quantifies the percent of green turf cover for each plot.</p>
        <p><strong>Water Star qualified Products</strong></p>
        <p>Water Star Qualified grass seed is available as a single variety, or as an ingredient in several of our mixes and blends. Water Star Qualified varieties are available across all major grass seed types: Tall Fescue, Kentucky Bluegrass, Perennial Ryegrass, Fine Fescue and Bermudagrass.</p>
