        <br /><p>When lawn disease strikes, your dreams of a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3824943D6FB5400595AB06811D58D745&amp;_z=z">thick, beautiful lawn</a>&nbsp;may seem to slip out of reach. But the solution to your problems can be as simple as disease I.D. and changes in your lawn care routine. Most <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">common lawn diseases</a>&nbsp;start with fungal pathogens that can't flourish unless conditions favor their growth. With proper lawn disease identification and disease-fighting culture, you can control disease and enjoy a healthy lawn.</p>
        <p>Active from spring through summer and fall, dollar spot disease focuses on grass leaves. Frequent hosts of dollar spot include <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BF7695A96AD446A88583DE2A7104697F&amp;_z=z">perennial ryegrass</a>, fine fescue and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=60708E64FDA14027B8542BBF652C634C&amp;_z=z">centipede grass</a>, but tall fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, Zoysia grass and Bermudagrass are also susceptible. Late summer can be particularly tough for lawns with dollar spot.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms and signs:</strong> Grass blades affected with dollar spot look water-soaked and show yellow spots ringed in reddish brown. Yellow-tan, "silver-dollar-size" lawn spots start about 2 to 6 inches wide, but then grow into large, irregular patches. Cobweb-type growth appears between blades.</li>
            <li><strong>Contributing factors:</strong> Dollar spot thrives when warm, humid days pair with cool nights. Water stress, from drought or excess moisture, support the disease. Underfertilizing and excess thatch contribute as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural control:</strong> Fertilize with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=010FB17DA9A94E25AEFB993DA8D9C8C9&amp;_z=z">high-quality nitrogen fertilizers</a>&nbsp;to help keep dollar spot at bay. Avoid water stress. Time irrigation for early morning to reduce the time that grass stays wet. Raise your mowing height during hot periods to limit drought stress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When cultural controls fail to manage fungal lawn diseases, a lawn fungicide can help. As with garden fungicides, early treatment is key to preventing fungal pathogens from germinating and spreading. Many effective fungicides are available only to lawn professionals. Your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local county extension agent</a>&nbsp;is an excellent source for information on lawn fungicides and their use for lawn diseases.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/How-to-Control-Common-Lawn-diseases/dollar-spot.jpg"/><br /><p>For any type of lawn disease, choosing disease-resistant grass varieties plays an important role in disease prevention and control. Superior grass varieties such as purebred <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z">Pennington Smart Seed</a>&nbsp;grasses are backed by decades of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z">industry-leading research and breeding</a>&nbsp;to provide you with the finest in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=997F4AD467424A5580F7051F1C56B769&amp;_z=z">sustainability-enhancing lawn grasses</a>&nbsp;with outstanding disease resistance.</p>
