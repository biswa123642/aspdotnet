        <p>Help your houseplants thrive indoors by following these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water. Houseplants grow much more slowly indoors, especially as the weather cools. This means they require significantly less water than they did outdoors. After you move your houseplants indoors, don't water them until the top two to three inches of soil has dried out. At that point, mix <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C144A8777A7F4065AEAF08031C4A9DB1&amp;_z=z">Pennington Ultragreen Plant Starter with Vitamin B1</a>&nbsp;with water (as directed) to help houseplants avoid moving shock, which can cause excessive leaf drop.</li>
            <li>Fertilize. Because houseplants grow slowly indoors, they require less fertilizer during the winter months. Feed your houseplants when you first move them indoors with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1809E65BB04C4238B05ED02E18DFE976&amp;_z=z">Lilly Miller All Purpose Planting &amp; Growing Food 10-10-10</a>, which will give them the nutrients they need throughout the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li>Humidity. As temperatures dip outdoors, the heat is raised indoors, drying the air inside your home. Many houseplants require extra humidity to keep their leaf tips from turning yellow or brown, or from curling. Some plants can lose leaves or buds completely. Provide additional humidity by spraying plants with a fine mist of water two to three times a day. Also, group plants to raise the humidity level, or create humidity trays &mdash; gravel-filled dishes or containers that you fill with water to just below the top of the gravel. When you place plants on the gravel, the water beneath humidifies the surrounding air &mdash; and the plant &mdash; when it evaporates.</li>
        </ul>
