        <p>When moss takes up residence on roofs or structures, curb appeal isn't all that suffers. Left unchecked, moss can lead to structural damage, and that means extensive home repairs. Heavy moss growth weighs down roofs, displaces shingles and retains moisture that leads to rot and water damage. Patios and walkways become unsightly and unsafe. But eliminating structural moss doesn't have to be difficult.</p>
        <p>With the proper approach and effective moss controls, you can overcome destructive moss and take back your structures:</p>

        <p>Mosses aren't like other plant pests, so they don't respond to traditional treatments used for common weeds and unwelcome plant growth. Other unwanted plants in your lawn or garden transport nutrients and water &ndash; and pesticide treatments &ndash; through roots and vascular systems, but mosses are primitive plants that don't have either one. Instead, mosses keep their tissues hydrated by wicking up water from below and soaking it in from above. Retaining moisture is critical to moss survival; without water, mosses can't live. While ordinary weed killers don't get past moss defenses, successful moss treatments target their weakness.</p>
