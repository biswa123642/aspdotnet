        <h2>How to Use One Step Complete</h2>
        
        <p>Because Pennington One Step Complete comes premixed and ready to use, you don't have to prep the product at all. Just three simple steps separate you from quick, successful lawn patch and repair:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the damaged area by removing any dead grass or debris and raking it lightly with a garden rake.</li>
            <li>Spread the One Step Complete seeding mixture over the area. For bare spots, use approximately 1 cup per square foot. (For Bermudagrass lawns, use 3/4 cup per square foot.) For extended areas, apply One Step Complete at a rate of 1 pound per 15 square feet.</li>
            <li>Water the area well. As you water, watch the wood mulch in this super-absorbent mix turn darker in color. That visual cue signals grass seed has the moisture it needs.</li>
        </ol><div><br></div>
        
        <br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Quick-Simple-Lawn-Repair-with-One-Step-Complete/Pennington-Tall-Fescue.jpg"/><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>With One Step Complete, you can see results in as little as two weeks.</em></p>
        <p>Continue to water your patch and repair areas to keep them moist until seedlings emerge and grass reaches the recommended mowing height on your product label.

Under proper growing conditions, you'll see results with Pennington One Step Complete Sun &amp; Shade, Dense Shade and Tall Fescue products in two weeks or less.
