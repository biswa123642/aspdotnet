        <h2><a name="SpringTipsforNorthernLawns">Spring Tips for Northern Lawns</a></h2>
        <p>When spring arrives in northern climates, lawn care shifts into high gear. Common cool-season lawn grasses such <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E9E74E8EFEF84B619745C5F04A41DB0D&amp;_z=z">tall fescue</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AE203707184C477AB8090DB6B59FDE09&amp;_z=z">Kentucky bluegrass</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BF7695A96AD446A88583DE2A7104697F&amp;_z=z">perennial ryegrass</a>&nbsp;enter one of their peak growth periods of the year. These northern lawn care tasks can take your lawn from early to late spring with optimized beauty and health:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flush lawn areas affected by de-icing salts</strong> or dog urine once soil thaws enough that water drains well. Salts from de-icers and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2A04E2EB9AD44D0C8FBF89C8DF4D780C&amp;_z=z">pet urine</a>&nbsp;can accumulate in soil and damage grass and other plants. By flushing soil thoroughly with hose water, you help move salt out of the root zone and reduce lawn damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Fight lawn disease by raking lawn areas</strong> once your soil and grass dry out slightly. This removes dead grass and debris, improves air circulation, helps soil warm faster, and protects against damage from snow mold and other&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">common lawn diseases.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Start mowing</strong> once your grass shows active growth. Timing varies from year to year, depending on your region's weather, so watch for signs of fresh green growth. For your first spring mowing, cut slightly lower than your grass's normal mowing height. Bag your clippings for the first few mowings if you suspect winter-related fungal disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply pre-emergent herbicides</strong> such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=61ABDA1C8C6F4E6A820B4F753F3FA37A&amp;_z=z">crabgrass preventers</a>&nbsp;to established lawns before weed seeds germinate. This typically happens when soil temperatures warm to near 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Most lawn and garden stores carry inexpensive soil thermometers to help you track temps. Your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local county extension agent</a>&nbsp;can also help with guidance for your area. Pre-emergents can inhibit grass seeds as well as weed seed, so always wait at least 60 days and two mowings before seeding areas treated with pre-emergent herbicides.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a name="SpringTipsforSouthernLawns">Spring Tips for Southern Lawns</a></h2>
        <p>In southern lawns, spring lawn care builds slowly. Common <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EB81614ED373435A88A451F2FA909053&amp;_z=z">warm-season lawn grasses</a>, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8B832BE060A847128826904BCF0DDA32&amp;_z=z">Bermudagrass</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5FAA97A823F44827B5690E3BCAAF52FC&amp;_z=z">Zoysia grass</a>, are just beginning to exit dormancy on their way to greening up. These springtime tasks for southern lawns can help your lawn move from early to late spring so it's ready and positioned for the surge of summer growth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mow your lawn</strong> once in early spring, before green up. Mow slightly shorter than your grass's <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z">recommended mowing height,</a>&nbsp;and rake to remove any dead grass or debris. This improves air circulation to fight fungal lawn disease and exposes soil to help it warm faster. If you <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1199218D755448F9043188507755D2E&amp;_z=z">overseeded for winter color,</a>&nbsp;continue your regular lawn care schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Spot-treat tenacious weeds</strong> early in spring while your warm-season grasses are still dormant and brown. Weeds steal resources away from grass, and they leave seeds behind. Green, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z">actively growing weeds</a>&nbsp;stand out against dormant grass, making targeted spot treatments swift and simple.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply pre-emergent herbicides</strong>, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=61ABDA1C8C6F4E6A820B4F753F3FA37A&amp;_z=z">crabgrass preventers</a>, to established lawns before summer weed seeds can germinate. Crabgrass seed germinates when soil temperatures hit 55 degrees Fahrenheit for several days. In southern lawns, pre-emergent season can start in mid-February. If you're unsure of timing in your area, check with your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local extension agent</a>. An inexpensive soil thermometer, available at most lawn and garden stores, also helps.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for early spring lawn pests</strong> such as <a href="https://www.amdro.com/learn/lawn-pests/protecting-your-turf-against-mole-crickets">destructive mole crickets</a>, which emerge and mate as soon as soil starts to warm. Treat these lawn pests now and again in late spring when newly hatched nymphs are most susceptible to treatment.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start regular mowing</strong> once your grass starts growing. Most warm-season lawn grasses enter active growth around the time that soil temperatures warm to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Mow slightly shorter at first, then raise your mower blades to normal mowing height. Bag and dispose of your clippings if you have&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">signs of fungal lawn disease.</a></li>

            <li><strong>Water your lawn</strong> so it gets about 1 to 1 ¼ inches of weekly water, from rainfall and irrigation combined. Don't leave your sprinkler on automatic. Let the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EF4854612E644CA6990C0C1832390434&amp;_z=z">Pennington Water Rate Calculator</a>&nbsp;help you determine how much supplemental water your lawn needs, based on real-time weather in your area. Deep, infrequent watering encourages deeper, more resilient root growth. Shallow, frequent watering does the opposite.</li>
