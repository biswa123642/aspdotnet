        <p>There's a secret behind achieving a beautiful, lush lawn. Landscape professionals know what it is, but many homeowners don't. Overseeding&mdash;as part of a comprehensive, proactive plan&mdash;keeps lawns looking great. Whether you're tending your first lawn or have years of experience, learning how to overseed your lawn can improve your results.</p>
        <p>Overseeding is spreading grass seed over an existing lawn. Done right, it's a straightforward process that gets results. As grasses mature, thinning is normal&mdash;especially if you enjoy your lawn and use it often. Overseeding keeps your lawn competitive and steeped in youth and vigor, without starting over from scratch.</p>
        <p>The basics of overseeding are the same everywhere, but goals and timing vary based on geography and the type of grass grown. For success with overseeding your lawn, follow this basic guide:</p>

        <h2><a name="EstablishYourGoal">Establish Your Goal</a></h2>
        <p>Homeowners overseed to correct thin lawns, but pros overseed to prevent thinning. For lawns in southern regions, overseeding warm-season grasses&nbsp;with cool-season reinforcements adds green color during winter. When warm-season grasses go brown, overseeding with a premium, cool-season ryegrass, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=26B85B3F852242F5B39C3C68D34E5C8B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Pennington Annual Ryegrass</a>, provides a green temporary lawn while your permanent, warm-season grasses are dormant.</p>
        <h2><a name="TimetheTask">Time the Task</a></h2>
        <p>The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D63DCF0805FA413D809FE6A2A9C9975B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">best time for planting cool-season grasses</a>&nbsp;in northern regions is late summer to early fall, when they're growing most vigorously. Spring is the second best time. The warm soil encourages seed germination, cool fall air stimulates growth, and soil moisture stays more constant. Tough, warm-season <a href="https://www.imageforweeds.com/all-blogs/killing-lawn-weeds/five-top-lawn-weeds-you-can-do-without" target="_blank">lawn weeds</a>, such as crabgrass and <a href="https://www.imageforweeds.com/all-blogs/weed-identification/identify-and-kill-nutsedge-or-nutgrass-in-lawns" target="_blank">nutsedge</a>, are less active in fall, too. The Turfgrass Water Conservation Alliance service recommends overseeding at least 45 days before your average first fall frost.<sup>1</sup> In southern areas, overseed thinning lawns in late spring, as warm-season grasses enter active growth. For winter color, overseed southern lawns in fall. Wait until nighttime temperatures drop consistently below 65&deg;F and your existing warm-season lawn slows and begins to lose color.</p>

        <h2><a name="PreparetheArea">Prepare the Area</a></h2>
        <p>Mow your lawn extra short and remove the clippings, so new seed contacts soil and gets sunlight and water. Set your mower at two inches or less for regular overseeding. For southern lawns and winter color, set the blade as low as it goes, and cut just above the soil&mdash;what's known as scalping. Rake the soil with a metal thatch <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3D5EBDDD0F3647F18178255AD405847C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">rake to remove thatch</a>, clippings and debris. This loosens and exposes soil to receive seed.</p>

        <h2><a name="FertilizeOverseededAreas">Fertilize Overseeded Areas</a></h2>
        <p>Avoid weed &amp; feed products; the pre-emergent herbicides&nbsp;inhibit seed germination.

Phosphorus supports vigorous root growth, while nitrogen fuels top growth and greening. Some states and counties restrict phosphorus lawn fertilizers due to environmental concerns regarding runoff, but exceptions may be made for new seedings. Check with your local <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">county extension agent</a>&nbsp;about nutrient application restrictions.</p>
        <br />
        <h2><a name="KeepYourLawnWell-Watered">Keep Your Lawn Well-Watered</a></h2>
        <p>Newly overseeded lawns need consistent moisture. Keep seed and soil moist with frequent, light waterings twice a day for the first four days; water more heavily every other day for the next five days; then water as needed to prevent wilting. This encourages deep, healthy roots.</p>
