        <p>Always follow all local water regulations that impact lawn maintenance. When conditions call for stricter measures, these water-conserving practices can help drought-stricken lawns survive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce irrigation gradually over several weeks, instead of all at once. This allows grasses and other landscape plants to acclimate to water shortages.</li>
            <li>Adjust watering or irrigation schedules every week to compensate for current weather conditions and changing regulations.</li>
            <li>Adjust irrigation systems to reduce or avoid watering areas that receive shade, and keep available water focused on exposed lawn.</li>
            <li>Consider smart controllers, which sense soil moisture and automatically adjust irrigation based on current soil and weather conditions, to minimize water use.</li>
            <li>Shut down automated irrigation systems during severe shortages, and water critical areas by hand only.</li>
            <li>Avoid fertilizing. Fertilizer promotes new growth that requires more water, and stressed lawns are also more prone to fertilizer burn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even before drought hits, prepare your lawn by mowing higher than <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">normal recommendations</a> during hot summer months. This helps shade roots and soil, and promotes deeper roots that can draw water from larger areas.</p>
