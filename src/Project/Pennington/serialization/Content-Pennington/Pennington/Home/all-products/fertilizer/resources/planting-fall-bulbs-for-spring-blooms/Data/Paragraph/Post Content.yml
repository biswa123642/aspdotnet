        <p>Just as winter reaches the point where it seems it may never end, there is a glimmer of hope. Tiny green foliage emerges from the frosty ground in very early spring, followed quickly by pretty blooms. Aptly named snowdrops are the first blooms that emerge, followed by showier mid-season blooms, such as daffodils and tulips.<sup>1</sup> By planting a variety of early spring-blooming bulbs, you can enjoy the progression of winter into spring with each new flower. But that means planning ahead and planting bulbs in the fall.</p>
        <h2>Selecting the Right Bulbs</h2>
        <p>While it is tempting to select a bulb variety solely based on its appearance, you must first make sure that type of flower will grow in your hardiness zone. Every region in the United States is assigned a hardiness zone by the United States Department of Agriculture, based on the average annual minimum winter temperature.<sup>2</sup> Once you know your flower selection can grow in your region, choose a color scheme. With so many varieties of spring bulbs, you can select a collection to best match your landscape, or choose a wide variety of colors for a more "wildflower" look.</p>
        Consider selecting at least one bloom from each category below to keep a steady supply of color in your landscape.<sup>1</sup>

        <h2>Planting Flower Bulbs</h2>
        <p>Well-drained soil is necessary for bulbs to survive year after year. Soggy soil causes bulbs to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=43E5D0C712EC46149D39480A64E26927&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">rot</a>,<sup>3</sup> so amend dense soils before planting. Since bulbs should be left undisturbed in garden beds for several years before being divided, do all soil work prior to planting. Take the following steps to plant:</p>
