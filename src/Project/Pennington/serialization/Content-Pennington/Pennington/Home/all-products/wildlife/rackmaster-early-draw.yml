        RACKMASTER Early Draw combines a blend of warm and cool season annuals in a single package to provide an irresistible late summer/early fall food source to draw deer in early for bow hunting and hold them in the area for the entire hunting season and beyond. Oats, cowpeas and buckwheat quickly germinate and grow, luring deer from the surrounding area to the food plot in late summer and into fall. As winter sets in, carbohydrates contained in the leaves of the Trophy Radish and purple top turnips are converted to sugars providing deer with a highly palatable source of energy during the colder months following the rut. After the leaves are consumed, deer continue to ingest valuable nutrients by browsing on the large roots formed by the radish and turnip plants. &nbsp;RACKMASTER Early Draw seed blend features RapidResults seed germination enhancement technology which promotes quicker emergence and stronger, deeper root growth. The result is a hardier and more productive food plot that will attract and hold wildlife in the area longer.<br>
        <p><strong>USES:</strong></p>
        <p>By bow hunters for early food plot deer attraction. To attract and hold deer in the area throughout the hunting season. To provide a highly palatable source of protein and energy nutrition from late summer through fall and into the colder months following the rut.</p>

      Value: "<p><strong>Planting:</strong><br /> <strong>Method:</strong> Choose a site that receives a minimum of 8 hours of full sun. Prepare a clean, smooth and firm seedbed by plowing and dragging the soil. Fertilizer and lime can be applied during this step to incorporate it into the soil. Plant with a drill or broadcast seed evenly across the soil surface and incorporate it using a culti-packer or by shallow disking. Care should be taken to ensure seed are planted at the proper depth. &nbsp;If seed are disked in, the use of a culti-packer or roller after seeding ensures good seed/soil contact and improves stand emergence.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Seeding Date:</strong> <em>South </em>- Sept. 1 thru Oct. 1; <em>Upper South </em>&ndash; Aug. 15 Sept. 15; <em>North</em> - Aug. 1 thru Sept. 1&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Seeding Rate:</strong> 100 lbs. /acre or 2 &frac12; lbs. /1000 sq. ft.<br /> <strong>Seeding Depth:</strong> 1/2&rdquo; (stand failures will result from seed planted too shallow or too deep).<br /> <strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Soil testing is highly recommended. Liming to a pH of 6.0-6.5 and providing adequate levels of potassium and phosphorus are necessary to ensure a productive food plot. See your local county extension office for soil sampling assistance. In the absence of a soil test, apply 400 &ndash; 600 lbs. /acre 10-10-10 (10 &ndash; 14 lbs. /1000 sq. ft.) or an equivalent fertilizer and 1 ton/acre ag lime (50 lbs./1000 sq. ft.). Apply fertilizer just prior to seeding. If practical, apply lime a minimum of 3 months before planting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Management:</strong><br /> <strong>Fertilizer:</strong> To obtain maximum production, apply an additional 30 &ndash; 50 lbs. /acre nitrogen 30 &ndash; 60 days after emergence with the application of 100 &ndash; 150 lbs. /acre 34-0-0 (or equivalent) nitrogen fertilizer.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Tips for Successful Food Plots:</strong><br /> 1. Every successful food plot begins with a soil test. Most woodland soils have low pH and low fertility. A soil test will tell you how much fertilizer and lime is needed. Information on taking a soil test can be obtained from your local county extension office.<br /> 2. Spend the extra time necessary to properly prepare the soil by plowing, smoothing and firming the ground. Planting on a weed free, smooth and firm seedbed that allows good seed-soil contact is essential for a thick, productive forage stand.<br /> 3. Plant seed at the proper seeding depth. Planting too shallow or too deep can result in stand failure. Seed mixes containing small seeded legumes and forbs should not be seeded deeper than &frac14; inch. Use a cultipacker, log or a light drag to firm the soil after planting.<br /> 4. When selecting a wildlife food plot site, choose an area that is long and narrow with curves or bends in it. This provides a sense of comfort and safety for wildlife. When developing food plots, a good rule of thumb is to plant 2.5 to 7 acres of food plots for every 100 acres of habitat.<br /> 5. Avoid droughty sites such as eroded hillsides or shallow, rocky soils. Southwest facing slopes are hotter in the summer and tend to dry out faster than bottom land.&nbsp;<br /> 6. A minimum of 50% full sunshine is essential for a healthy and productive food plot. Morning sun is better than afternoon sun for summer game food plots. The reverse is generally true in the winter.</p>"
