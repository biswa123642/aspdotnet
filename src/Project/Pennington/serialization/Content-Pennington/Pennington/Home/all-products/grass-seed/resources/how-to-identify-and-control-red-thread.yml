        <br /><p>When lawn disease strikes, your dreams of a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3824943D6FB5400595AB06811D58D745&amp;_z=z">thick, beautiful lawn</a>&nbsp;may seem to slip out of reach. But the solution to your problems can be as simple as disease I.D. and changes in your lawn care routine. Most <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">common lawn diseases</a>&nbsp;start with fungal pathogens that can't flourish unless conditions favor their growth. With proper lawn disease identification and disease-fighting culture, you can control disease and enjoy a healthy lawn.</p>
        <p>Red thread disease prospers during moderate temperatures, attacking grass leaves from early to late spring and again from late summer into fall. Perennial ryegrass and fine fescue are particularly susceptible to pathogens behind this disease, but red thread affects bluegrasses and bentgrasses, too.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms and signs:</strong> Reddish-pink discoloration on your shoes, mower and lawn tools is a clear signal of red thread disease. Closer inspect reveals reddish-pink threads throughout your lawn. Grass leaves wither from the tip to the ground as red thread progresses, creating red-tinged or bleached-out patches in lawns.</li>
            <li><strong>Contributing factors:</strong> Cool, wet spring temperatures provide ideal conditions for red thread's development. Poor air circulation, too much shade, high humidity, and extended periods of wet grass all support this disease. Underfertilizing, compacted soil and excessive thatch also contribute.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural control:</strong> Remove lawn clippings to improve air circulation and battle red thread disease.&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=205E7E70E3F849C2BA7E490D41317996&amp;_z=z">Fertilize regularly</a>&nbsp;with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E7247749803C4EA388D03BE4B8E39FF6&amp;_z=z">premium high-nitrogen lawn fertilizers,</a>&nbsp;and irrigate early in the day so sun and wind dry grass fast. Aerate compacted lawns and remove excess thatch. For shaded lawns, choose <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F7A51AF54D4641D08202A5E054ACEDE6&amp;_z=z">grasses that do well in shade</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When cultural controls fail to manage fungal lawn diseases, a lawn fungicide can help. As with garden fungicides, early treatment is key to preventing fungal pathogens from germinating and spreading. Many effective fungicides are available only to lawn professionals. Your <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06BAFB66433242B1B3F352A693463AA1&amp;_z=z">local county extension agent</a>&nbsp;is an excellent source for information on lawn fungicides and their use for lawn diseases.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/How-to-Control-Common-Lawn-diseases/red-thread-lawn-disease.jpg"/><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Red Thread (Laetisaria fuciformis) close up.</em></p>
        <p>For any type of lawn disease, choosing disease-resistant grass varieties plays an important role in disease prevention and control. Superior grass varieties such as purebred <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z">Pennington Smart Seed</a>&nbsp;grasses are backed by decades of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8BA6C8C2AB5349B2B748717467523AC8&amp;_z=z">industry-leading research and breeding</a>&nbsp;to provide you with the finest in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=997F4AD467424A5580F7051F1C56B769&amp;_z=z">sustainability-enhancing lawn grasses</a>&nbsp;with outstanding disease resistance.</p>
