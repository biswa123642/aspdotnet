        <br />Keeping your lawn lush and healthy requires attention every month of the year. Knowing what to do and when to do it is essential. Warm-season grasses, such as Bermudagrass, Zoysia grass and Bahiagrass, thrive in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z">southern regions.</a>&nbsp;They go dormant over winter, return to active growth in spring, and peak in dry, hot summer weather.<br>
        <br>
        With a helping hand from this monthly care guide, you can keep your warm-season lawn grasses at their best. Keep in mind that seasonal changes within a region can occur over several weeks, and weather trends change every year. So, turn to your local conditions and your lawn for the final word, but let this month-by-month guide be a starting point.

        <strong>January</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep mower blades sharp and lawn tools ready. Spring comes early in southern zones.</li>
            <li>Neaten dormant, far-south lawns with midwinter <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=28DE422F58A44408B5C99AD451DD8A45&amp;_z=z">edging</a>&nbsp;and a trim.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z">Take annual soil samples</a>&nbsp;in any trouble areas. Soil must be thawed and relatively dry. Test other lawn areas at three- to four-year intervals.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>February</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Fight <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2C64CDEAB9AB4B049F521A80D7216EBB&amp;_z=z">winter weeds</a>&nbsp;with post-emergent herbicides and spot treatments. Green, active weeds are easy to spot in brown, dormant, warm-season lawns.<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li>Check lawns for debris, twigs and stones before spring arrives.</li>
            <li>It's time to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=254DCB3BF82248E9B4818CFA0B38BCC0&amp;_z=z">treat established lawns</a>&nbsp;with pre-emergent herbicides before summer weeds and crabgrass germinate. A soil thermometer, available at garden supply stores, lets you know when soil temps near 55 degrees Fahrenheit – the temperature at which crabgrass germinates.<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <strong>March</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Mow lawns once grass starts growing. Cut slightly lower than standard <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z">mowing guidelines</a>&nbsp;for the first few times. Collect clippings if you suspect disease.</li>
            <li>Apply <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=113E1E75B92540AA911805EA6AB2B974&amp;_z=z">soil amendments</a>, such as fast-acting lime, according to soil test recommendations. This restores balance to soil pH and improves soil structure.</li>

        <strong>May</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Aerate and dethatch lawns during active spring and early summer growth. This reduces compaction, improves drainage and reduces risks of&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">lawn disease.</a></li>
            <li>Water established lawns so they get the equivalent of 1 to 1 1/4 inches of weekly moisture, including precipitation, as dormant grasses return to green.<sup>4</sup> Water-conserving Water Star grass varieties, such as Pennington's hybrid Bermudagrass Princess 77, require less water than normal varieties.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>June</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Feed warm-season grasses every four to eight weeks during their active summer growth period.<sup>4</sup> <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=652C4491FD974B2AAFA7005ED29EA0ED&amp;_z=z">Pennington UltraGreen fertilizers</a>&nbsp;treat grasses to fast-acting and slow-release nutrition.</li>

        <ul>

Later feedings can interfere with dormancy and hardiness.<sup>1</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <strong>September</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce watering of warm-season grasses; needs decrease as rains increase, But never allow turfgrass to be stressed by lack of water, or it will affect spring green-up.</li>
            <li>Treat established lawns with pre-emergent herbicides before cool-season winter weeds germinate, when nighttime air temperatures approach 65 to 70 Fahrenheit.<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1199218D755448F9043188507755D2E&amp;_z=z">Overseed</a>&nbsp;for temporary green winter color with cool-season perennial ryegrass. When warm-season grass begins losing color, it's time.</li>

        </ul>
        <strong>October</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Mow warm-season grasses until they stop growing. Make final cuts slightly lower than normal.</li>
