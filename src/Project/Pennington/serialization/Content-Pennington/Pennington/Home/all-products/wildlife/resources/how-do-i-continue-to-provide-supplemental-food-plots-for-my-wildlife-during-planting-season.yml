        </strong>Q: How do I continue to provide supplemental food plots for my wildlife during planting season?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:<br />
        </strong>A: Most wildlife enthusiasts completely destroy their food plots in order to plant a new one each season. Pennington does not recommend this method, as it removes the food source from the animals until new seedlings emerge and causes excess pressure on the new seedlings. Our recommendation is to strip plant* your food plots or to incorporate some permanent food plots and some annual plots, so that your animals have a constant food supply. <br />
        <br />
        <em>
        *A strip planting example: If you have a two acre food plot, disk and plant everything but &frac12; acre. Once your new plants are growing well, plant the last &frac12; acre. </em></p>
