        <p />Pennington Kentucky 31 Tall Fescue helped revolutionize the grass seed industry. This durable, heat-tolerant variety was an early leader in putting low-maintenance, disease-resistant lawns within the average homeowner's reach. Decades later, this economical, traditional tall fescue grass remains an industry standard for cool-season lawn grasses.<p />
        <p>This tough, drought-resistant grass thrives in lawns that receive 4 to 8 hours of sun. Plant it in the early spring or early fall and start to see results within 8 to 21 days. A 5-pound bag covers up to 1,000 square feet for overseeding an existing lawn and 415 square feet for starting a new lawn from scratch.</p>
        <p>While most grass seed companies buy their seed on the open market, we are the only major grass seed company that works directly with a network of dedicated growers. Built on decades of trust and integrity, our relationships with seed growers and their families now span multiple generations. Our legacy of working directly with farmers to bring you the finest grass seed possible helps ensure their success and ours. At Pennington, we know our seed and the farmers who grow it. From field to final product, that's the Pennington way. </p>
