        <br />Hummingbirds aren&rsquo;t the only visitors to hummingbird feeders. Downy Woodpeckers, orioles, and even some warblers are frequent visitors. Bats, squirrels, raccoons, and other mammals have a sweet tooth. Bees, wasps, and ants may also show up. And every now and then, a moth that looks surprisingly hummingbird-like appears.<br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/Hummingbird-Moths/hummingbird-moth.jpg"/><br /><p>Several different species of nectar-feeding moths are all called &ldquo;hummingbird moths&rdquo; for their similar habits and even similar appearance to hummingbirds. Being moths, they don&rsquo;t have a bird&rsquo;s beak, but they roll their mouth parts in and out of the nectar. Moths have antennae; these can appear quite feather-like on many species, including some hummingbird moths, but unlike birds, lack any actual feathers. Hummingbird moths have large dark eyes that look very birdlike, especially from a distance.</p><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/Wild-Bird/Hummingbird-Moths/Hummingbird-moth-on-flower.jpg"/><br />Bees, wasps, and ants can become a nuisance at hummingbird feeders, both for people and for hummingbirds, but hummingbird moths don&rsquo;t cause problems for us or hummers. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to spot one, sit back and enjoy!
