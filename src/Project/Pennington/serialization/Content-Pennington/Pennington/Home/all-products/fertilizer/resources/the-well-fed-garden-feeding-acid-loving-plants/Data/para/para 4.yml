        <h2>Keeping Acid Lovers On Track</h2>
        <p>Fertilizers designed for plants that thrive in acidic soil help circumvent high-pH problems. These plant foods encourage acidic soil and provide added iron and other micronutrients through specialized formulas.&nbsp;Lilly Miller<sup> </sup>UltraGreen<sup> </sup>Azalea, Camellia &amp; Rhododendron Food&nbsp;10-5-4 fertilizer combines natural ingredients with traditional plant food in a blend that acts fast and then slowly releases nutrients for up to three months.&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B76612E386114B2180AD1293ED9060AD&amp;_z=z">Lilly Miller<sup> </sup>Rhododendron, Evergreen &amp; Azalea Food&nbsp;10-5-4</a>, with cottonseed meal and other natural ingredients, feeds acid-loving plants for up to six weeks.</p>
        <p>If a nutrient deficiency strikes, a soil test and corrections are in order, but plants need immediate help. Products such as&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=805AD8614306462CA480034ABA21481E&amp;_z=z">Ironite<sup> </sup>Plus Plant Food&nbsp;12-10-10</a>&nbsp;tackle iron chlorosis with iron, sulfur and extra minerals in a fast-acting form.
