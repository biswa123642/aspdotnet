        </strong>Q: How essential is soil pH in the development of a food plot?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:<br />
        </strong>A: Soil pH has everything to do with the establishment of healthy plants and directly relates to the plant's ability to absorb soil nutrients, which are necessary for plant survival and health. A pH of 5.0 is considered acidic and may cause as much as 50% waste of fertilizer. Using lime will raise the soil pH, making the soil less acidic and root systems more robust. Most plants perform well in soil with a pH of 6.5.</p>
