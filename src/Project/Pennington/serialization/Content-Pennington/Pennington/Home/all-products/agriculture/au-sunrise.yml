      Hint: Accordion3
      Value: "<p><strong>Planting:</strong><br /> <strong>Seeding Dates:</strong> Sept. 1 - Nov. 1 (Consult the local Extension Office for specific dates for the region.) Plant seed approximately 1/4 inch deep.<br /> <strong>Rate:</strong> For pure stands: 20 - 25 lbs./A broadcast or 15 &ndash; 20 lbs/A drilled. In mixes: 12 &ndash; 15 lbs./A&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Depth</strong>: &frac14; - &frac12; inch<br /> <strong>Method:</strong> Seed can be broadcast over a clean prepared seedbed or drilled in with a no-till planter equipped with a small seed hopper. If broadcast on a prepared seedbed, cover the seed with a light disking or press the seed into the soil with a culti-packer or similar roller device. Whether broadcasted or drilled alone or in mixes, seed should be placed at a maximum depth of 1/2 inch. Planting crimson clover seed too deep can result in stand failure. &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Soil testing is highly recommended. As a legume, AU Sunrise requires no commercial nitrogen fertilizer.&nbsp;Liming to a pH of 6.0-6.5 and providing adequate levels of potassium and phosphorus are necessary to ensure a productive clover stand. See your local county extension office for soil sampling assistance.<br /> <strong>Inoculant:</strong> AU Sunrise seed come pre-inoculated with selected Rhizobia strains of bacteria for optimal root nodulation and nitrogen fixation.</p> <p><strong>Management:</strong><br /> <strong>Grazing:</strong> Begin grazing when clover growth reaches 6-8 inches in height. &nbsp;For maximum productivity and utilization, use a managed grazing system whereby a 10-20 day rest period is allowed between grazings. Note: Bloat can be a problem for animals on pastures with a large proportion (&gt;35%) of clover. Bloat-preventative supplement materials are recommended.<br /> <strong>For Conservation Use:</strong> When used as a green manure or cover crop for conservation tillage/organic production systems, terminate the crimson clover just prior to seed head development for maximum nitrogen benefit.&nbsp;</p>"
