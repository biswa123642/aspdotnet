        <br />Keeping your lawn lush and healthy requires attention every month of the year. Knowing what to do and when to do it is essential. Warm-season grasses, such as Bermudagrass, Zoysia grass and Bahiagrass, thrive in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F423D45A84B044C69D3E2C32F557C476&amp;_z=z">southern regions</a>. They go dormant over winter, return to active growth in spring, and peak in dry, hot summer weather.<br>
        <br>
        With a helping hand from this monthly care guide, you can keep your warm-season lawn grasses at their best. Keep in mind that seasonal changes within a region can occur over several weeks, and weather trends change every year. So, turn to your local conditions and your lawn for the final word, but let this month-by-month guide be a starting point.
