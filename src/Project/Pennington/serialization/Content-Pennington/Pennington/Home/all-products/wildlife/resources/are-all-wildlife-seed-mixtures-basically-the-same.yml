            <li> Decide when you want the mixture to provide supplemental feed for your wildlife.</li>
            <li>Decide how often you want to plant the mixture.</li>
            <li>Determine whether you will need a high protein mix or one that will feed a large number of animals.</li>
            <li>Evaluate your property: Do you have full sun or partial shade?</li>
            <li>Determine planting area and the season in which you want to plant.</li>
            <li>Set your budget.</li>
            <li>Evaluate soil pH requirements and nutrient requirements for the seed mixture.</li>
            <li>Determine quantity of mixture needed to plant the total habitat.</li>
