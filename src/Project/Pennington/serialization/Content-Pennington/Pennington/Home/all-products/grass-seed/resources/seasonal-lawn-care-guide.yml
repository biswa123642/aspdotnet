Stay on top of your lawn's needs with these spring lawn care tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start mowing</strong> as soon as your grass starts growing. The first time out, mow slightly shorter than <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=736E84A5BAD8455C8CAA5F2C7746267C&amp;_z=z">recommended mowing heights</a>&nbsp;and bag your clippings to reduce the risk of winter-related&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=88C5F2CF26464892A2B9E1C356B98BD9&amp;_z=z">fungal disease.</a></li>

        <p>Summer's higher temperatures and lower rainfall causes cool-season grasses to slow down or even go dormant during extreme heat or drought. But warm-season lawn grasses thrive during summer heat and enjoy their peak growth time. Respond to the season and support your grass with these summer lawn care tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: lighter;"><strong>Water according to your weather</strong> with the help of Pennington's Water Rate Calculator. Depending on grass type, most established lawns need 1 to 1 1/4 inches weekly water—including rain—to stay healthy and green. Conserve on water with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C7B2DCDBC53B4F5981E47A5B2D1768C8&amp;_z=z">Pennington Smart Seed grasses</a>. Once established, these purebred grasses require up to 30 percent less water than ordinary grasses and stay green up to three weeks without watering.</span></li>
            <li>
            <strong>Treat turf pests</strong> such as newly hatched grubs while they're small, close to the surface, and feeding on your grass roots. Effective treatment stops the damage and prevents new generations of pests.</li>
            <li><strong>Test your lawn soil</strong> every three to four years to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1B9244270BF24BB1A86C684A02845DC3&amp;_z=z">confirm your soil pH and its nutrient needs</a>. Always test problems areas separately. You'll have results and be ready for fall adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Raise your mowing height</strong> about 1 to 1 1/2 inches higher than normal during summer heat to help shade grass roots, reduce evaporation, and encourage deeper root growth. Never remove more than one-third of the blade at a time.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Fertilize warm-season grasses</strong> every four to eight weeks during active growth. Plan your final feeding at least six to eight weeks before you expect frost.</li>
        </ul><div><br /></div><br /><img src="/-/media/Project/OneWeb/Pennington/Images/blog/seed/Seasonal-Lawn-Care-Guide/watering-lawn.jpg" /><br /><h2><a name="FallLawnCareGuide">Fall Lawn Care Guide</a></h2>
        <p>With the advent of cooler temperatures and falling autumn leaves, cool-season lawn grasses launch into their most active period of growth. Warm-season grasses slow down and begin to go dormant. Help your lawn prepare for the coming winter and next spring with these fall lawn care tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Seed and overseed cool-season lawns</strong> to renovate, thicken and strengthen. Fall conditions are ideal for germination and establishment of cool-season lawn grasses.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Overseed warm-season lawns</strong> as they begin to turn brown and go dormant. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BF7695A96AD446A88583DE2A7104697F&amp;_z=z">Cool-season ryegrass adds temporary green color</a>&nbsp;through winter.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Fertilize cool-season lawns</strong> in early fall, at least six weeks before you expect frost.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Treat broadleaf weeds in cool-season lawns</strong> with<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=91259B678503496FA443889A1B119951&amp;_z=z"> post-emergent herbicides, such as weed &amp; feed fertilizers.</a><br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Amend your soil, according to test results. </strong>Overly acidic soil may need <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A9C4E0AAE8454C9CBC6D320EE685DECA&amp;_z=z">lime to restore pH balance</a>. Gypsum helps loosen heavy clay soil and enhance root growth.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Lower your mower blades</strong> back to normal height as temperatures turn cooler. Keep mowing until your grass stops growing. Prep grass for winter with a slightly lower final mow.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Aerate and dethatch cool-season lawns.</strong> Peak growth translates to quick recovery and renovation.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Rake fallen leaves </strong>so grasses get plenty of sun and air.</li>

        <p>Winter months find cool-season, northern lawns blanketed in snow, while most warm-season grasses are dormant and brown. Southern lawns overseeded with cool-season color need regular maintenance all winter long. Winter lawn care tasks like these get you and your lawn ready for next season:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Sharpen and clean mowers and tools </strong>so they're ready for spring. Sharp mowers and clean turf tools lessen the risk of grass damage and disease—and they make lawn and garden tasks easier.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Continue to water, mow and fertilize overseeded southern lawns</strong> on a regular schedule.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Soil test trouble areas</strong> in southern lawns, if soil is thawed and dry.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Spot treat winter weeds in southern lawns </strong>with targeted treatments; weeds stand out against dormant warm-season grasses.<br />
            <strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Keep your lawn clear of stones or winter debris</strong> so it's ready to go if spring comes early.<br />
