        <p>Lawn weeds spoil the beauty of a lush, green lawn, but some weeds don't stop there. Aggressive weeds, like the top five that follow, spread quickly and choke out grass wherever they grow. Don't despair when weeds invade; take prompt, effective action instead. Kill difficult lawn weeds, protect your grass and keep your thick, beautiful lawn.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #008563; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.1;">BITTERCRESS</h2>
        <p>An annual broadleaf weed, bittercress only lives a single year. But before it dies, it produces prolific seed to ensure a repeat next season. A common winter weed in moderate climates, this lawn weed germinates year-round in cool, moist conditions. What starts as a small, flat, green rosette quickly becomes a large mat of rounded leaflets. Thin flower stalks send up small, white flowers that produce numerous needlelike seed pods. When ripe pods burst, seeds fly several feet in all directions.</p>
        <p><em><img height="533" alt="hairy-bittercress" width="800" src="-/media/B7D1585097C24DB4BE6CCD816CC8EF7F.ashx" /></em></p>

        <h2 style="color: #008563; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.1;">CLOVER</h2>
        Erosion control specialists often use white clover for quick groundcover and extensive roots. Those same qualities make this perennial broadleaf weed and its strawberry-pink relative fast-moving, invasive lawn weeds. Able to flourish in undernourished soil, clover easily outcompetes weak grass. Large patches of small, rounded white and pink flowers and classic "three-leaf" clovers quickly form. This aggressive lawn weed comes back season after season, and its seed can survive in soil for many years.<br />

        <h2 style="color: #008563; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.1;">CRABGRASS</h2>
        Crabgrass seems to live forever, but it's actually an annual warm-season weed grass. Like bittercress, it completes its full life cycle in a single year, but it leaves lawn owners something to remember it by. A single crabgrass plant can generate up to 150,000 seeds.1 Germination starts in spring and continues all summer until temperatures get too warm. Low mowing won't prevent seed heads. This weed's coarse, crablike stems and leaves grow so low they avoid mower blades, even in very low lawns.<br />

        <h2 style="color: #008563; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.1;">DANDELION</h2>
        Dandelions are broadleaf perennial weeds that produce fuzzy yellow flowers and white puffball seed heads on hollow, leafless stalks year after year. The plants grow in rosettes of serrated leaves and spread aggressively to form large masses in lawns. Long taproots beneath each plant can extend up to 18 inches deep.2 Attempts to pull dandelions usually fail; they spring back from broken roots vigorously. When puffy seed heads disperse, seeds can travel several miles on the wind.<br />
        <p><em><img height="534" alt="dandelion-yellow-flower" width="800" src="-/media/F0BDF4BA0B2E4454B7682C3803003407.ashx" /></em></p>

        <h2 style="color: #008563; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.1;">NUTSEDGE</h2>
        Also known as nutgrass, nutsedge isn't a grass or a broadleaf weed. This difficult lawn weed is a sedge, identified by its triangular stems. Its yellow-green grassy leaves and spiky yellow-brown flower heads stand out clearly in lawns. Nutsedge spreads by seeds, underground stems and underground tubers known as nutlets. One plant can form thousands of nutlets in a season. Nutlets can stay protected deep in soil for up to 10 years before finally coming forward to produce more nutsedge plants.<br />
        <p><em><img height="531" alt="nutsedge-image" width="800" src="-/media/4D353AA0BB0B4F00ACCB369640AE177B.ashx" /></em></p>

        <p><span style="color: #000000;">Controlling these persistent lawn weeds and others requires killing these invaders, roots and all. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F17A1D6D084242C6AA95B7C202AAD70C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">IMAGE All-In-One Lawn Weed Killer</a>&nbsp;starts working on contact to kill tough weeds in established lawns all summer long.
