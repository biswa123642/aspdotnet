          The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand turf-type tall fescue combines the sensory
          appeal of rich, green color and fine texture with the resilience and
          durability that modern lawns demand. By understanding what makes turf-type
          tall fesuce a leading choice for high-quality, high-performance turf, you're
          on your way to a thick, uniform, low-maintenance lawn that's a cut above the
          rest.

        <ul>
          <li>Cool-season, bunch-forming, perennial grass</li>
          <li>Suited to all but the southernmost U.S.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Extensive Growing Region</h2>
        <p>
          High-quality turf-type (TT) tall fescue offers one of the largest growing
          regions of any common U.S. lawn grass. As with other cool-season grasses, TT
          tall fescue peaks in growth during cool fall and spring weather, and it
          thrives across the northern United States. However, improved tolerance for
          both heat and cold extends this grass's usefulness and growing range.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to cool-climate use, TT tall fescues excel in the transition zone
          where many other lawn grasses struggle. In this difficult grass growing zone —
          too hot for traditional cool-season grasses and too cold for many warm-season
          lawn grasses — versatile TT tall fescues deliver. With
          <a href="/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b5BFEEEC1-BA98-4418-9E43-B0A37678E329%7d%40en" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Tall Fescue Blend</a>, you enjoy durable, fine-textured lawns that stand up to heat and cold and

        <p style="text-align: center">
          <em>Tradition tall fescue grasses have a much broader, coarser blade than
            turf-type tall fescues.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Distinctive Growth Habit</h2>
        <p>
          Turf-type tall fescue differs from many traditional lawn grasses in its
          bunch-forming growth habit. Modern tall fescue turf grasses descend from
          tough, hardy, agricultural grass introduced to the United States from Europe.
          Like their pasture-grass ancestor, turf types naturally form clumps and spread
          by tillers. This growth by vertical shoots instead of horizontal stolons and
          rhizomes distinguishes tall fescue from most common U.S. lawn grasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some early tall fescue types could take on a clumpy, uneven look as lawns
          matured. Turf-type tall fescue varieties in
          <a href="/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7bB78E94D1-CBBF-4289-A1BC-D31E1C2473DA%7d%40en" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand seed blends and mixes</a>&nbsp;— developed through years of research and innovation — produce a thick,
          uniform turf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bunch-forming growth has some additional advantages. These grasses rarely have
          problems with thatch, so you skip the maintenance, pests and disease problems
          that heavy thatch-producing grasses can bring. Boundaries and bed lines are
          also much easier to maintain with bunch-forming lawn grasses. Your landscape
          looks cleaner and more finished with less edging work.
        </p>
        <h2>Environmental Tolerances</h2>
        <p>
          Tall fescues naturally have deep, extensive root zones that typically reach 2
          to 3 feet deep.1 Deeper than any other common cool-season U.S. lawn grass,
          this naturally extensive root system provides access to water and other
          resources beyond the reach of grasses with limited root depth and density.
          This translates to increased tolerance for heat, drought and even poor
          drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/resources/why-choose-the-rebels" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Extended Root Seed Varieties</a>&nbsp;grow up to 40 percent more roots at deeper depths than ordinary grass
          seed. These improved turf-type tall fescue varieties optimize your lawn's
          drought resistance, reduce supplemental irrigation needs and improve nutrient
          uptake, leaving your lawn less susceptible to environmental conditions that
          stress and weaken other grass types.
        </p>
        <h2>Shade Tolerance</h2>
        <p>
          Many widely used lawn grasses, including Kentucky bluegrass and Bermudagrass,
          struggle without adequate sun. When your lawn is an integral part of a
          landscape that includes ornamental shrubs and shade trees, grasses with high
          sun requirements work against curb appeal. High-performance TT tall fescues
          are among the most shade tolerant of all cool-season grasses, yet they thrive
          in sunny conditions, too.

          mix combines a blend of adaptable, shade-tolerant TT tall fescue varieties
          with fine fescue, the only cool-season lawn grass with better shade tolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in areas receiving less than four hours of direct sun per day, these seed
          mixes produce attractive, dense, dark green, finely textured lawns. Shaded
          areas blend visually with the rest of your tall fescue lawn and deliver all
          the drought, disease and traffic tolerance you expect from The Rebels<sup>®</sup>

        <h2>Turf-Type Tall Fescue Lawn Care</h2>
        <p>
          Get the most from your tall fescue lawn in performance and beauty, with proper
          care and maintenance. By following best practices for tall fescue, you keep
          your lawn at its peak.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Major Lawn Tasks</b> - For cool-season grasses such as tall and fine
          fescues, plan major lawn tasks for their optimal growth periods in fall and
          spring. For TT tall fescue, late summer to early fall is the best time to
          plant seed or do other major projects such as overseeding or aerating. The
          cool air temperatures combined with warm soil temperatures enhance seed
          germination, speed establishment and aid quick recovery. Spring is the second
          best time for these major tasks on your tall fescue lawn. Time tall fescue
          lawn projects properly, follow best practices for planting seed, and the
          natural growth cycle works to your advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Irrigation </b>- Proper watering is critical to maintaining a healthy,
          vibrant fescue lawn. Frequent, shallow watering encourages roots to stay close
          to surface moisture, where they're more vulnerable to heat and drought.
          Deeper, less frequent watering encourages deeper root growth and strengthens
          your lawn's resilience to stress. During normal growing conditions, provide 1
          inch of water per week. In intense transition zone summers, you may need
          double that amount. Always adjust your watering regimen based on your local
          weather, from heavy rainfall to extended drought. Adjustments help ensure your
          fescue lawn retains healthy color and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Fertilization </b>- The dense, deep root growth of The Rebels® Brand tall
          fescue varieties improves your lawn's ability to take up naturally available
          soil nutrients and those you add through fertilizers. Grass uses fertilizer
          more efficiently, and you get more value from fertilizer input. Tall fescue
          adapts well to various soil types and growing conditions, and typically
          requires less fertilizer than other cool-season grasses in similar soils. Test
          your soil, maintain soil pH roughly between 5.5 and 7.5, and follow soil test
          recommendations for fertilization. You'll maximize nutrient availability and
          efficiency for your tall fescue lawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mowing </b>- Improved TT tall fescue varieties in The Rebels® Brand produce
          a darker, greener, denser lawn than older tall fescue types, such as Kentucky
          31. Their lower, more uniform growth simplifies mowing as well. Ideal mowing
          height for turf-type tall fescues is between 3 and 4 inches. Taller heights
          during times of heat and drought encourage deeper root growth, help shade
          soil, reduce weed competition and help grass withstand stress. Maintain grass
          height so you never remove more than one-third of the blade length in a single
          mowing. This helps keep your tall fescue lawn at optimal strength and health.
        </p>
        <p>
          With improved turf-type tall fescue grasses, you can enjoy a thick, beautiful,
          durable lawn that withstands the most challenging conditions. But your lawn is
          only as good as the seed you grow.
