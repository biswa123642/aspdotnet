        <p>Planting turf-type tall fescue under the best possible conditions gives your seeding project a distinct advantage. Whether seeding a new lawn or overseeding existing turf with The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B78E94D1CBBF4289A1BCD31E1C2473DA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">premium grass seed products</a>, proper timing supports high germination rates and thorough establishment. To get the most from your grass seed and your seeding efforts, time your planting to build on tall fescue's strengths and meet its needs.</p>
        <h2>Best Conditions for Tall Fescue Seed</h2>
        <p>
          As a cool-season grass, established tall fescue grows best during the cooler
          soil and air temperatures that happen in late summer to early fall and again
          in early spring. Newly seeded turf-type tall fescue follows the same timing
          for optimal natural growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tall fescue seed needs soil temperatures near 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit for
          thorough germination and strong root development. These soil temperatures
          roughly correspond to fall and spring air temperatures in the range of 68 to
          77 F.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          By timing tall fescue seeding to coincide with these conditions in your
          growing region, you work with natural advantages instead of against them —
          whether you seed in fall or spring. Your tall fescue seed gets off to a strong
          start, before seasonal stresses of winter or summer arrive.

          <em>Fall is the ideal time for seeding or overseeding tall fescue lawns.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Fall Planting of Tall Fescue</h2>
        <p>
          Late summer to early fall is the best time to plant tall fescue seed. Fall
          offers several advantages not available any other time of year. As air
          temperatures drop in autumn, soil still retains some summer warmth. Cool
          nights, moderate days and warm soil are ideal ingredients for fast, thorough
          germination and sturdy establishment of tall fescue seed. Fall planting offers
          other benefits, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fall rains typically arrive about the same time that favorable air and soil
          conditions align. Tall fescue seed requires consistent moisture during
          germination, and gentle fall rains meet that need. Unlike spring, when soil
          often becomes overly wet, fall soil is more likely to maintain healthy
          moisture levels. Many aggressive lawn weeds go dormant as temperatures fall,
          so new grass faces less weed competition. Insect pests become less active, so
          you have fewer fall problems on the pest front, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideal fall seeding time for turf-type tall fescues, such as
          <a href="/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b5BFEEEC1-BA98-4418-9E43-B0A37678E329%7d%40en" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Tall Fescue Blend</a>, varies depending on where you live. In general, plant tall fescue at least
          45 days before your region's typical first fall frost date. This allows time
          for the 7- to 21-day germination period for turf-type tall fescue plus
          adequate time for roots to establish before winter comes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Upper Midwest lawns, mid-August may bring ideal conditions. In transition
          zone states, such as North Carolina or Arkansas, September is typically the
          best month for planting tall fescue seed.<sup>1</sup> If you plant late,
          expect lower germination rates and less hardy root establishment. However,
          ungerminated seed may stay viable through winter and some additional
          germination may come with spring.
        </p>
        <p>
          With early fall planting, seed gets a full fall growing season. Then spring
          brings another period of cool-season growth before summer stress arrives.
          Seeding with high-performance seed such as
          <a href="/resources/why-choose-the-rebels" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Extended Root Seed Varieties</a>&nbsp;offers even greater protection against heat and potential drought.
          These outstanding turf-type tall fescues grow 40 percent more roots at deeper
          depths than ordinary grass seed, offering greater heat and drought tolerance
          as well as improved nutrient uptake.

          <em>Cool weather in fall and spring presents optimal condition for seeding tall
            fescue.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Spring Planting of Tall Fescue</h2>
        <p>
          As post-winter soil and air temperatures warm, spring is your second best time
          to plant tall fescue seed. As in fall, time spring planting to coincide with
          soil temperatures of 60 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer and consistent air
          temperatures between 68 to 77 F.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimal spring planting times vary by location. In transition zone lawns,
          ideal conditions may arrive in March. Farther north, favorable conditions may
          wait until April or even early May. In most of tall fescue's growing range,
          the landscape provides timing clues. Early-flowering yellow forsythia bushes
          bloom when soil temperatures reach 55 F. Confirm soil temperature with a soil
          thermometer, and plan tall fescue seeding accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          While spring offers good conditions for planting tall fescue, it holds some
          challenges. Heavy rains and melting snow or ice can keep soil cold for
          extended periods, inhibiting germination and giving hardy weeds a head start.
          Cool, overly wet soil also encourages the development of fungal diseases that
          can impact germination, seedling growth and established lawns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spring planting gives tall fescue less time to get established before summer
          heat replaces favorable growing temperatures. As a result, spring-planted tall
          fescue may struggle more than fall-planted seed. In challenging southern
          conditions, choosing tall fescue varieties with superior heat and drought
          tolerance, such as those in
          <a href="/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b5BFEEEC1-BA98-4418-9E43-B0A37678E329%7d%40en" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Southern Classic Blend</a>, can improve your lawn's resilience to southern summers.

        <h2>Tall Fescue Follow-Through</h2>
        <p>
          Planting tall fescue at the best time gives your lawn the best possible start,
          but timing isn't the only factor in seeding success. Follow best practices for
          planting grass seed, from seed selection and soil testing to proper care
          during germination and beyond. Keep your grass and soil healthy and positioned
          for vigorous grass growth, and maintain your new tall fescue at recommended
          mowing heights of 3 to 4 inches.
        </p>
        <p>
          By planting high-quality, high-performance tall fescue seed, such as The
          Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand tall fescue seed products, your lawn benefits from
          years of turf-type tall fescue innovation and research. By timing your seeding
          properly and giving your lawn
          <a href="/" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand</a>&nbsp;advantage,
