          One of the important aspects of seeding your lawn happens before you ever lift
          a tool. Your lawn is only as good as the seed you grow. Turf-type tall fescues
          can produce a high-performance, low-maintenance lawn that you can take pride
          in. Choosing high-quality tall fescue grass seed such as
          <a href="/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b5BFEEEC1-BA98-4418-9E43-B0A37678E329%7d%40en" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Tall Fescue Blend</a>&nbsp;helps ensure you get outstanding turf-type varieties you can count on
          for success.

          <a href="/resources/why-choose-the-rebels" target="_blank">The Rebels<sup>®</sup> Brand Extended Root Seed Varieties</a>&nbsp;offer added advantages beyond the benefits of a turf-type tall fescue
          lawn. Developed through extensive research and innovations, these varieties
          grow up to 40 percent more roots at deeper depths than ordinary grasses. With
          added resilience, these high-performance varieties position your lawn to
          thrive under conditions that cause other grasses to struggle and fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your lawn includes areas with limited sun, selecting shade-tolerant seed
          can make the difference between failure and success.

          <a id="OptimalTiming">Optimal Timing</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Timing your seeding to correspond with tall fescue's natural growth cycle
          optimizes every aspect of your seeding project. As cool-season grasses, tall
          fescues establish best during late summer to early fall when cool weather
          supports vigorous growth. Early spring offers the second best planting time
          for tall fescue seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tall fescue germinates best when soil temperatures near 60 to 65 degrees
          Fahrenheit. For fall seeding, wait for soil to cool to this range. Hold spring
          seeding until soil warms. By planting during these optimal seasons of cool
          temperatures and strong growth, you also take advantage of fall and spring
          rains. That means less supplemental watering and less labor for you.

          <a id="SoilTesting">Soil Testing</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your tall fescue lawn's health and future performance depend in large part on
          your soil and the availability of its nutrients, including those added through
          fertilizer. Doing soil tests before you seed reveals your starting point for
          soil improvement and grass nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil testing confirms your soil pH, organic matter and other measures.
          Reputable soil laboratories will provide detailed recommendations on starter
          fertilizers and soil amendments to benefit your future lawn. Follow test
          recommendations. They help ensure the thick, healthy, vibrant lawn you've
          planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tall fescue adapts to various soil types and tolerates a broader pH range than
          many other lawn grasses. It does best when soil pH stays between 5.5 and 7.5,
          where essential nutrients remain available to your grass. Your soil may need
          soil amendments, such as lime or elemental sulfur, to restore pH balance and
          nutrient availability. Mix all test-recommended fertilizers and amendments
          into the top 6 to 8 inches of soil before you seed.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a id="SitePreparation">Site Preparation</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Early site preparation focuses on removing weeds and unwanted grasses. If you
          have existing turf, removing it with a sod cutter is one option. Non-selective
          herbicides, which kill both broadleaf plants and grasses, offer another
          approach. Many herbicides require multiple applications and significant
          waiting periods before you can seed, so time early site prep appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rake the area to create a flat, level planting surface. Fill in any low-lying
          spots where water could accumulate and cause drainage problems. Correct
          grading issues that could complicate mowing or send water toward your home
          instead of away. A gentle grade that drops about 1 foot per 50 feet should
          drain well without draining too fast.<sup>1</sup> If your property has steep
          grades, consider professional advice to avoid erosion and potential mowing
          problems.

          most from your tall fescue seed, follow the label guidelines for seeding
          rates. New lawns require about twice the amount of seed needed to overseed a
          thin, existing lawn. Seeding at rates higher or lower than label
          recommendations wastes quality seed and labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take time to measure your seeding area correctly. Subtract for your home and
          other buildings, and calculate seed and spreader settings accordingly. For
          precision seeding or lawns less than 5,000 square feet, consider a drop
          spreader. For larger lawns or less precise seeding, a broadcast or rotary
          spreader works well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your tall fescue seed is down, rake it in so 1/4 inch of soil covers the
          seed. This allows for the right amount of protection and light penetration.
          Then roll the area with a lawn roller to ensure good soil-to-seed contact.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a id="Post-PlantingCare">Post-Planting Care</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Grass seed requires consistent moisture for germination and establishment.
          Proper watering is critical to seed success. Irrigate newly seeded areas
          frequently, so the top 1 inch of soil remains moist.<sup>1</sup> This may
          require several waterings per day as tall fescue seed germinates over seven to
          21 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          With seedlings up and growing, lengthen the time between waterings. Water
          deeper and less often, until you gradually reach your norm for established
          lawn. Let new tall fescue grow about 4 1/2 inches tall before you mow it. As
          with all lawn grasses, only remove one-third of the leaf blade at a time. Mow
          as needed to maintain a recommended height of 3 to 4 inches.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid all weed control products until you mow your new planting at least three
          times. Protect new fescue lawns against heavy foot traffic, including children
          and pets, as seed becomes fully established during its first growing season.
        </p>
