        <p>The Rebels launched the first Turf Type Tall Fescue grass seed in 1979, revolutionizing the grass seed market. Tall Fescue was originally used as a forage-type grass for pastures, grazing and hay crops. After years of research, The Rebels first variety was genetically improved to be finer bladed and lower growing which made it ideal for lawns because it creates a durable, beautiful turf that is drought tolerant.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the years, The Rebels has continued to improve the grass cultivars used in its product by making the grass darker green, finer bladed and more turf type in appearance. The current product is more than ten generations removed from its original Turf Type Tall Fescue, making it The Rebels best product ever.</p>
