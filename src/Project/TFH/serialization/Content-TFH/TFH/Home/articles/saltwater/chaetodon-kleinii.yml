Basic coloration is brownish yellow with a black bar through the eye and black snout. One or two additional vertical bars can be white or beige.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>The butterflyfishes contain some excellent choices for the marine aquarium, as well as some terrible choices. This is one of the best. Smaller than many other species, this butterfly is also hardy and adapts well to captivity. And although it will eat live coral, it is not an obligate corallivore and can be maintained on regular aquarium fare. If anything, its main drawback is its shyness. It is very important to provide hiding places and to make sure that tankmates are not aggressive.</p>"
