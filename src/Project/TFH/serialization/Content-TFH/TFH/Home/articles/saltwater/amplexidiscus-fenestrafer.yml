      Value: "<h1>Amplexidiscus fenestrafer</h1><br> <p></p> <p><b>Common Names:</b> Elephant ear coral, giant cup mushroom</p> <p></p> <p><b>Phylum:</b> Cnidaria (soft corals)</p> <p></p> <p><b>Class:</b> Anthozoa</p> <p></p> <p><b>Order:</b> Corallimorpharia</p> <p></p> <p><b>Family:</b> Discosomatidae</p> <p></p> <p><b>Range:</b> Tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean</p> <p></p> <p><b>Natural Environment: </b>Thought to be the only species in its genus, this coral is found in shallow waters in lagoons and tidepools, often in turbid and still waters. It is generally a tan color, but depending upon where it was collected, the elephant ear coral may be ivory.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Water Requirements:</b> Calcium 380 to 430 ppm, alkalinity 2.5 meq/l, pH 8.1 to 8.2, specific gravity 1.025, nitrate &lt;30 ppm, phosphate &lt;0.015 ppm, and a temperature range of 72&deg; to 83&deg;F.</p> <p></p> <h3>Captive Care</h3> <p>These mostly photosynthetic corals, which can attain a diameter of 12 to 14 inches, are among the easiest of all large-polyped soft corals to maintain since they do better in somewhat nutrient-rich surroundings with medium light intensity and gentle water movement. They are not true anemones, nor are they true corals. However, they are closely related to both organisms&mdash;being somewhere in between&mdash;and more study is needed to define precisely what they are.</p> <p></p> <p>This is a large polyp that can actually change its shape fairly quickly (sometimes within a few seconds) from an open and flat disc-like form to a closed, onion-shaped polyp and trap an animal inside, which it will then eat. In fact, any fish or shrimp crossing over its broad surface that touches its short tentacles will trigger a closing action. Nevertheless, most animals seem to realize the danger and do not risk lingering on its surface. Yet during evening hours, if a fish attempts to sleep on the coral&rsquo;s open surface area, it may become trapped inside, where it will become breakfast.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Feeding</b></p> <p>Directly hand feeding this species is not necessary because it is largely a photosynthetic animal, quite similar to the common mushrooms and capable of absorbing dissolved nutrients directly from the water. Nevertheless, occasionally (i.e., once a month) placing a small piece of fresh fish, clam, or shrimp flesh near the central mouth area will usually trigger a closing action and the consumption of the food. Feeding small elephant ear corals will result in fairly quick increases in growth, but adult size remains as noted above.</p> <p></p> <p>If the food is not consumed, remove it and try a few days later. I&rsquo;ve had this species a few times and almost always found it to like an occasional snack. If the elephant ear continues to fail to take a tasty snack, it may be due to aquarium conditions such as light intensity and water quality/movement, so it may need to be moved to a new location in the tank. The ideal areas are on the bottom substrate, where currents are gentle and there is reduced light intensity. And as to location, I&rsquo;ve found the species to be much like large sea anemones, with each species finding a preferred location in my aquariums; unfortunately this species is incapable of moving itself, so the aquarist must decide its best placement.</p>"
