These make excellent aquarium specimens.</p> <p></p> <h3>Fish Description</h3> <p>Highly laterally compressed. Brilliant deep blue with yellow tail and pectorals, bold black marking from eye to tail with an open ring int he middle of the back; the black may form a complete or incomplete ring around the blue circle. (Some see a resemblance to the thumb hole of an artist's palette.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>One of the two most popular tangs in the hobby, this fish is ubiquitous in reef and fish-only aquaria. It is probably the least aggressive tang, and it typically tolerates other fish, including conspecifics, provided the aquarium is large enough. In truly immense setups, it is possible to maintain a small school if the individuals are added all at one time.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Tankmates</b></p> <p>Tankmates should be chosen carefully, as this fish cannot prevail against bullies or aggressive feeders. The hepatus tang is safe with just about any other fish, though long, dangly fins or spines may prove too much of a temptation and elicit a nip or two.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Water Quality</b></p> <p>Like all acanthurids, P. hepatus demands pristine, well-oxygenated water. Powerful filtration, protein skimming, and regular water changes are necessary for prolonged health. This fish deserves its popularity, but it also demands strict attention to water quality and to diet to keep it healthy. In other words, it is hardy and long-lived in aquarium conditions, but only when cared for properly.</p>"
