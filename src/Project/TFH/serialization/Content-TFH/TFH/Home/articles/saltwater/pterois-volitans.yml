There has been confusion about the status of the extremely similar P. miles. Recent studies support the division and suggest that the species replaces P. volitans in the western part of its range.

Their Atlantic distribution suggests considerable cold tolerance for a tropical species.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Difficulty:</b> A very hardy aquarium fish, but the sting is venomous. Be very cautious when handling or working with any fish in the family Scorpaenidae.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Tank Setup:</b> As a large predator this fish requires very large tanks with superb filtration and frequent water changes, which makes it unsuitable for reef systems.

Although they are easily trained to take non-living foods, many lionfish die an early death at the hands of hobbyists who feed them mainly or exclusively on live gol</p> <p></p> <p><b>Breeding:</b> Fry have not yet been successfully raised in captivity.</p> <p></p> <h3>Fish Description</h3> <p>The bold striping and elaborate finnage of a lionfish is recognized even by non-aquarists. The color of the stripes varies from red through brown to black.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>Many of these magnificent animals languish in undersized, underfiltered tanks with an inadequate diet. Kept properly, they are beautiful, fascinating, and long-lived. With careful planning they can be part of a large fish-only community in an aquarium of several hundred gallons. On a smaller scale they can be interactive pets in a single-specimen setup.</p> <p></p> <p>The natural tameness and curiosity of these fish increase the importance of extreme care when working with your hand in the tank; it is best to put a barrier between you and the fish. The reproducing population of this fish off the Atlantic Seaboard appears to be having a negative impact on native fish populations, and this has many people calling for adding this species to our diets, as it is an esteemed food fish in Asia.</p> <p></p> <p>Collecting these popular aquarium specimens for the trade is another viable option. The decreased shipping time would mean lower prices and better condition of the fish.</p>"
