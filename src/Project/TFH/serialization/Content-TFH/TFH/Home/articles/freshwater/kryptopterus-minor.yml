It is a diurnal, shy, transparent fish that dwells in midwater and is an obligate schooler. A heavily planted tank with some open space will bring out the best of these animals. They may hide for several days when first introduced, and they are quick to dive into the thickets when disturbed. They can become quite bold, however, at feeding time. It is very common to find the entire school identically aligned, heading into currents, shimmying to stay in place. Often purchased as a novelty, this fascinating fish holds your interest with its interesting behaviors.</p>"
