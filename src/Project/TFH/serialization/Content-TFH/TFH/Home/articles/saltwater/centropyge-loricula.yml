      Value: "<h1>Centropyge loricula</h1><br> <p></p> <p><b>Common Names:</b> Flame angel</p> <p></p> <p><b>Type Locality:</b> Society Islands</p> <p></p> <p><b>Range:</b> Throughout the central Pacific Ocean</p> <p></p> <p><b>Taxonomic Troubles:</b> Originally described as Holacanthus loriculus; sometimes misnames Centropyge loriculus; loricula is correct.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Size:</b> To 15 cm (6 inches), usually smaller.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Preferred Water Chemistry:</b> Marine, tropical. Temperature 24 to 28 degrees Celsius (75 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit), SG 1.025, pH 8.3</p> <p></p> <p><b>Difficulty:</b> An easy marine if healthy to begin with.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Tank Setup:</b> Best kept in a mature live rock system. Aggressive and territorial with conspecifics. Males will fight to the death. Can often be maintained in pairs or harems. Provide numerous hiding places--live rock piles are ideal.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Feeding:</b> Primarily an algae eater. Must have marine algae or algae-based foods as the bulk of the diet. Mature live rock also provides small invertebrates. This species may pick on coral polyps and other sessile invertebrates.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Breeding:</b> Spawnings are quite common. Until recently, raising the young has been difficult at best, but commercially available tank-bred specimens are now on the market.</p> <p></p> <h3>Fish Description</h3> <p>Bright orange-red to deep red, depending on the population , with a variable blue-black blotch behind the pectorals and (in most specimens) four or five vertical bars. The tips of the dorsal and anal fins have alternating blue and black stripes.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>The flame angel has long been a favorite among saltwater hobbyists. As with many marine species, there is considerable variation in survivability based on the source of this fish. Once established and provided with an algae-based diet, this is one of the hardiest marine aquarium species. Its beauty only adds to its appeal, and now the availability of captive-bred animals makes this species a better choice than ever.</p> <p></p> <p>As with most dwarf angels, aggression can be a problem. Since these fish are protogynous hermaphrodites, buying the largest and the smallest fish you can find often will yield a pair. Or, obtaining a group of three or four young juveniles should get you a single-male harem. It is a timid species and needs a lot of tiny caves into which it can flee. It also does best when provided with a mature system with plenty of algae and healthy micro crustacean populations. Thus, a reef tank is a good environment for these fish; the question is whether they are good for a reef tank.</p> <p></p> <p>Although many reefers maintain this species in their tanks, its reputation is extremely variable, and many other hobbyists label it totally unsafe. The safest choice would be FOLR (fish-only-live-rock) setup. The Centropyge dwarf or pygmy angels enable aquarists to have the graceful stateliness of a marine angel without the problemns associated with many of the larger pomacanthids--extreme size, extreme territoriality, and extreme dietary requirements that are near impossible to meet. Among the dwarfs, the flame angel is deservedly one of the most popular.</p>"
