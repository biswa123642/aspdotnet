        <h1>Cichlid Camera Magic</h1><br> <p style='text-align:center'><b>Author:&nbsp;Mo Devlin</b></p> <p></p> <p> A noted cichlid photographer offers a selection of stunning photography and explains how exceptional scenes can be captured.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h3>Picture-Perfect Cichlids</h3> <p>I am a cichlid voyeur who spends countless hours standing in front of their home, camera in hand, observing and documenting their behavior as they live, eat, and breed. The fascination never dims.</p> <p></p> <p>My love for cichlids started long before I was ever introduced to a camera. My passion for photography led me down a career path that started in the army as a photojournalist and later a medical photographer. Today I am the owner of a small advertising agency. My two passions, cichlids and photography, have dovetailed nicely and provided me great pleasure over the years.</p> <p></p> <p>I credit my technical skills to the fact that I cut my teeth using the old manual Pentax and the Nikkormat film cameras. Their functioning was very basic; nothing was automatic. And everything was final once the shutter was pressed. Never was that fact more important than when I photographed autopsies while in the army. My boss was always fond of reminding me I had to get it right the first time. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t dig them up for a reshoot,&rdquo; he would say. Those hard-learned technical lessons certainly paid dividends when I got my first digital SLR.</p> <p></p> <p>I started taking pictures of my fish seriously with my Nikon film camera. I had mixed results or, as I like to look back at them, expensive experiments. While I could get an image, it was never anything worth putting on a wall. I fared a little better with my first digital point-and-shoot.</p> <p></p> <p>The big&nbsp;<i>ah-ha!</i>&nbsp;moment came when I bought my first Nikon DSLR camera. The pictures improved from a technical standpoint, but they were still lacking from a photographer&rsquo;s eye. Sure, I could get a nice image of a nice fish, but I wanted to create art&mdash;and that can fall into a couple different categories.</p> <p></p> <h3>Cichlid Behavior</h3> <p>As most who keep cichlids are aware, they are very interactive fish, some more so than others. I have said many times that the fish is doing all the heavy lifting. I&rsquo;m simply there to click the shutter. I know what to expect when my fish are breeding, but documenting behavior basically comes down to being in the right place at the right time.</p> <p></p> <p>The voyeur becomes the paparazzi. I shoot hundreds of pictures every week, and sometimes that much in a day. One of the things that most don&rsquo;t know is that for every good photo I show, there are more than twenty that never get off the memory card.</p> <p></p> <p>I can&rsquo;t prove it, but I could swear that some of my fish know they are being photographed. In particular, a pair of&nbsp;<i>managuense</i>&nbsp;that are arguably the most photographed individual pair of this species on the Internet. I take hundreds of photos of these fish in particular. They never fail to provide me with something that I can use.</p> <p></p> <h3>Capturing Fluid Beauty</h3> <p>One of the most intriguing things about fish is their liquid-like grace in water. Their movement seems effortless and comparable to birds in flight.</p> <p></p> <p>It&rsquo;s always a special treat when I can freeze that moment in time just before the fish flicks a fin and rockets into another part of the tank. Once again, it&rsquo;s about being in the right place at the right time. On rare occasions, you can anticipate movement and get the shot. When that happens, it becomes stop-action magic.</p> <p></p> <p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything from a laser pointer to the tips of my socked feet as tools to help get the desired results. After setting the lights on the tank, I step back and lure my subject into range. Then it&rsquo;s a simple matter of waiting for the fish. Patience has never been one of my virtues, but in this case, the payoff is big.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Bits and Pieces</b></p> <p>Is it the sum of all the parts, or can the parts themselves be the focus of a photo? Once, quite by accident, I got a photo of the tail end of a fish. It was another&nbsp;<i>ah-ha!</i>&nbsp;moment. A new avenue was opened, and I started taking pictures of smaller, more specific elements&mdash;they can indeed make a great picture. Some of my favorite photos now are simply close-ups of fins, eyes, fry, or scales.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Perfect Portraits</b></p> <p>How many times do you see the underside of a fish properly lit in a photo? A few years ago, I started experimenting with a three-flash setup. I would place one of the flash units beneath the tank pointed up through a cleared space in the gravel. The effect gave a new dimension to the photos.</p> <p></p> <p>This technique led me to try and capture better portraits of my fish. The better shots are the side-by-side comparisons of male and female. One shot in particular, a pair of fish with heads tilted up, was taken in simple fashion. I set up the camera and lights, and then put my lens cap on the top of the tank. When they looked up, I took the photo.</p> <p></p> <p><b>The Big Payoff</b></p> <p>For over a decade, I&rsquo;ve posted my photos across the Internet on dozens of forums, both national and international under the heading, &ldquo;Today in the Fishroom.&rdquo; Occasionally, I will get a note from a fellow aquarist saying that they picked up a fish simply because they saw it in one of my photos. Many of these folks are being introduced into the world of cichlids for the first time. For me, that&rsquo;s the ultimate compliment.</p> <p></p> <p>One of my good friends once jokingly said, &ldquo;One thing is for sure. If you get a fish in your tank, his life is well documented.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the truth! I like to believe that this is my contribution back to a hobby that has given me so much joy over the years. I hope to see you all at this year&rsquo;s American Cichlid Association convention in Washington, D.C. Bring your camera!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>See the full article on&nbsp;<i>TFH</i>&nbsp;Digital</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tfhdigital.com/tfh/201107#pg61" target="_blank">http://www.tfhdigital.com/tfh/201107#pg61</a></p>
