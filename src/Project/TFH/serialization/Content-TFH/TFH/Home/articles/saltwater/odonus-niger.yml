      Value: The Niger trigger is less territorial than other triggers, but should be kept with other fish that are the same size. You'll need a large tank to care for this species.

      Value: "<h1>Odonus niger</h1><br> <p></p> <p><b>Common Names:</b> Redtooth triggerfish, Niger trigger, blue trigger, purple trigger, black trigger</p> <p></p> <p><b>Type Locality:</b> N/A</p> <p></p> <p><b>Range:</b> Throughout the Indo-Pacific, Red Sea south to South Africa and east to the Marquesas and Society Islands, north to Japan, south to the Great Barrier Reef</p> <p></p> <p><b>Taxonomic Troubles:</b> Originally described as Xenodon (Balistes) niger. The genus Odonus is currently monotypic.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Size:</b> 50 cm TL (20 inches).</p> <p></p> <p><b>Preferred Water Chemistry:</b> Tropical marine</p> <p></p> <p><b>Difficulty:</b> A very hardy marine, but aggressive and large, so difficult to keep with other animals.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Tank Setup:</b> A very large tank is needed. There should be plenty of open swimming area but also several hidey-holes available, either live rock structures or artificial caves, like pieces of PVC pipe. A substantial current should be provided.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Feeding:</b> Naturally feeds on plankton and sponge. Will usually take a variety of foods in the aquarium. Fresh or frozen plankton-like foods (like mysids) are especially appreciated.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Breeding:</b> As with many triggers, the female guards the eggs. No known successful captive propagation.</p> <p></p> <h3>Fish Description</h3> <p>Color is quite variable, from greenish blue to blue, purple, or black. This, plus the distinctive body shape with lyre-shaped tail&mdash;not to mention the eponymous reddish teeth&mdash;make the fish easy to identify.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>This fish is one of the planktivorous triggers. It is usually found in schools in open water on the seaward side of a reef where there is a strong current, feeding on zooplankton. Thus, it is less territorial than some other triggers, but it still does best alone or in a huge tank with other similarly sized fish. It is definitely not reef safe, as it will feed on small motile and sessile invertebrates. Like all triggers, it possesses a dorsal spine with which it locks itself into a crevice at night, making it all but impossible for a predator to extract it.</p>"
