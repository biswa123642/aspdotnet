It has no sexual dimorphism and doesn&rsquo;t sleep in the sand, and despite its large teeth, it usually leaves tankmates alone unless they are small enough to eat. It is generally considered suitable just for fish-only setups, but some adventurous reefkeepers with very large systems have tried this species. Obviously these reef tanks did not include any small crustaceans or small fish&mdash;at least not for long!</p>"
