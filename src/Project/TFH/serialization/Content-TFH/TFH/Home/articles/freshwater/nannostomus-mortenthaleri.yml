      Value: "<h1>Nannostomus mortenthaleri</h1><br> <p></p> <p><b>Common Names:</b> Red arc pencilfish, Peruvian red pencilfish, coral red pencilfish, ruby red pencilfish</p> <p></p> <p><b>Type Locality:</b> Peru: a small tributary of Rio Nanay at the village of Alvarenga, Loreto, Province of Maynas (Iquitos)</p> <p></p> <p><b>Range:</b> Apparently very limited in range</p> <p></p> <p><b>Taxonomic Troubles:</b> Originally described as Nannostomus marginatus mortenthaleri</p> <p></p> <p><b>Size:</b> 3.9 cm TL (1.5 inches)</p> <p></p> <p><b>Preferred Water Chemistry:</b> Tropical, soft, slightly acidic.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Difficulty:</b> A hardy pencil, quite assertive for its size.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Tank Setup:</b> This is an active, schooling species that should always be kept in groups, which will also diffuse aggression. A planted tank is best. Can be kept with any other fish that are not big enough to eat them.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Feeding:</b> A micropredator. Relishes live or frozen foods, tank-bred specimens will readily take all regular aquarium fare.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Breeding:</b> This species is only starting to be bred by aquarists. It does not appear to be too difficult to spawn.</p> <p></p> <h3>Fish Description</h3> <p>Widely heralded as the all-red pencilfish, this species looks like N. marginatus painted red. Males are more colorful, but females are not drab.</p> <p></p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>Known as the &quot;$20 pencilfish,&quot; this is an expensive fish but still in demand because of its outstanding coloration. As captive-bred fish are becoming available, the price is dropping. The intense red coloration of this species has caught the attention of aquarists who are not generally interested in the lebiasinids&mdash;splashing tetras and pencilfish. The soaring popularity of planted nano tanks has also added to the demand for this fish, which is perfect for such a setup. It is reportedly extremely limited in range and population, but fortunately the availability of tank-bred specimens has lessened the demand for wild harvesting.</p>"
