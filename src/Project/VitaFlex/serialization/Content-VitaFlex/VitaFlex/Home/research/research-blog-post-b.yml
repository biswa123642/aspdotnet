There                                      must be hundreds of horse owners who have experienced                                      feelings of hopelessness and despair brought on by a coughing                                      horse. A "heavie" horse can mean anything from                                      occasional reduced time in the saddle to having the afflicted                                      animal put down. And, although there are alternative feed                                      products and medications that offer relief to the suffering                                      equine, the results are, for the most part, temporary                                      at best. Most of us who have found ourselves with a heavie                                      horse have desperately tried everything from beet pulp                                      to cortisone injections.                                 </p>                                 <p>     While our other two horses remained healthy, "Brushie,"                                      our 20-year-old Quarter Horse mare, suddenly developed                                      heaves, and in two years time her health, her attitude                                      and her body deteriorated to the point where there was                                      very little quality of life left for her. Instinctively                                      I knew the best thing I could do for my loyal old friend                                      was to give her death with dignity. However, just a few                                      short months ago, while I was struggling with that weighty                                      decision, I chanced upon an article that gave her a stay                                      of execution.                                 </p>                                 <p>     One day while looking for new, fresh material to                                      read regarding horses, I chanced upon the Summer 1989                                      issue of THE WESTERN HORSE magazine that was to turn our                                      lives around. An article by L. Sellnow, entitled, "MSM:                                      A Wonder Nutrient," proved to be the timely answer                                      to my prayers. Although the article primarily advocated                                      the effects of MSM on horses suffering from laminitis                                      (which had no real bearing on any of my horses' immediate                                      needs), I thankfully read the article to its conclusion,                                      because well into the article, it briefly stated: "(MSM                                      has) ... had success in clearing up both lung noises and                                      heaves."That sentence struck me like a bolt out of                                      the blue! The word "success"fueled the flames                                      of my last gasp of hope. Before the magazine dropped onto                                      my coffee table, I was on the phone ordering this wonderful                                      and mysterious MSM.                                 </p>                                 <p>(MSM is a registered acronym trademark* for methylsulfonylmethane,                                      a fine white powder credited with clearing up a myriad                                      of equine ailments including epiphysitis, arthritis, lameness,                                      and inflammation as well as increasing circulation. A                                      very impressive list of claims not to be taken lightly!)                                 </p>                                 <p>Brushie's heaves had reached the stage where lasix, azium                                      powder, and cortisone shots no longer offered her any                                      relief. Up until the spring of '89, the cortisone shots,                                      which were kept as a last resort - for the really wracking                                      bouts of coughing, could always be counted on to give                                      her at least two weeks of easy breathing, but they no                                      longer afforded her even an hour of relief.                                 </p>                                 <p> Once the cortisone shots proved ineffective, I desperately                                      grasped at the old wives' tale that fresh garlic eases                                      bronchial ailments and began sprinkling her grain with                                      diced garlic. The first dose of garlic caught Brushie                                      off guard; she drew the deepest breath she had drawn in                                      months, her nostrils flared, her eyes watered, and her                                      breath from that point on, was enough to melt down the                                      barn!!! Bizarre as it sounds, the fresh garlic gave her                                      a modicum of comfort. It seemed to offer her more comfort                                      than the cortisone shots did at this point and it was                                      considerably less expensive, but it wasn't long before                                      she refused her grain because of the taste and smell of                                      the garlic. She was, quite frankly, just a few weeks away                                      from death's door.                                 </p>                                 <p> When I began adding MSM<sup> </sup>to her feed it was                                      with the idea that we had tried everything else and had                                      nothing left to lose. If the MSM didn't give Brushie any                                      relief in a very short period of time, she would have                                      to be put down without further delay. MSM was the last                                      resort.                                 </p>                                 <p>Miraculously, by the end of the first week, it was obvious                                      that Brushie was not only breathing more comfortably,                                      but her constant coughing had subsided to only an occasional                                      cough. By the end of the second week, even the occasional                                      coughing ceased and her appetite increased. Once the coughing                                      stopped, we cut the dosage in half. This was indeed a                                      miracle! After a little more than two years of more or                                      less constant bronchial problems, it was sheer joy not                                      to hear hacking coughs and labored breathing coming from                                      the paddock.                                 </p>                                 <p>Although my husband and I were truly impressed by the                                      results of this wonderful white powder thus far, there                                      were still more to come. By the end of the third week,                                      it was all too apparent that Brushie's mental attitude                                      was improving along with her physical condition as she                                      reclaimed her former position as the "Backyard Boss"                                      with the vigor and enthusiasm of a much younger horse.                                 </p>                                 <p> In her recovery she has gained back the weight she lost                                      and she is once again an alert, healthy animal with a                                      shiny coat, bright eyes and head held high. It's now been                                      more than six months since Brushie took her first dose                                      of MSM. The transformation is truly amazing. The "ol'                                      girl" in her rejuvenated state can out run our three-year-old                                      Thoroughbred without getting winded, and she looks and                                      acts half her age!                                 </p>                                 <p> Although Brushie had dropped several hundred pounds                                      during her lengthy illness and was nearly emaciated, she's                                      eating "like a horse" again and looks sleek                                      and healthy. And, all because of a white powder that offers                                      relief to lame horses.                                 </p>                                 <p> While I realize that more than two years may seem like                                      a long time for an animal to suffer through heaves, I                                      was guided by my veterinarian's advice that Brushie had                                      a strong will to live and was still reasonably comfortable                                      although her riding days seemed to be over. I also held                                      out hope for finding a cure. Brushie wasn't suffering                                      from a mere "touch" of heaves; she was nearing                                      the end of her rope and yet, just after a month of taking                                      MSM twice a day, it was obvious to all who had been in                                      contact with her over the last couple of years that she                                      was not only getting relief, but that she was back on                                      the road to good health. As of this writing, she is perky                                      and frisky. We're trail riding again, doing light cantering,                                      and Brushie is looking forward to her 23rd birthday! Best                                      of all, Brushie is no longer plagued by lung noises and                                      coughing. Thank you WESTERN HORSE magazine and L. Sellnow                                      for the introduction to MSM.
