Studies on the immunomodulatory properties                                      of dietary whey proteins in mice are reported. Ingestion                                      of bovine milk whey proteins, either as a supplement in                                      an adequately balanced commercial diet or as the only                                      protein source in a balanced diet, consistently enhanced                                      secondary humoral antibody responses following systemic                                      immunization with ovalbumin, when compared with other                                      protein sources such as soyabean protein isolate and ovine                                      colostral whey proteins. After 5-8 weeks of feeding, dietary                                      milk whey proteins enhanced cell-mediated immune responses                                      as revealed by footpad delayed type hyper-sensitivity                                      responses, and coneanavalin A-induced spleen cell proliferative                                      responses. To monitor nutritional effects of milk whey                                      proteins, live weight, leucocyte counts and clinical changes                                      of diet-fed mice were examined. The present results confirm                                      other previous results that dietary bovine milk whey proteins                                      have immunoenhancing properties in mice and these properties                                      are unlikely to be related solely to the nutritional effects.                                  </p>                                 <p>Whey contains a multitude of proteins that remain soluble                                      after precipitation of caseins during the manufacture                                      of cheese (Eigel et al. 1984). There are major components                                      such as ?-lactoglobulin, a-lactalbumin, serum albumin                                      and immuno-globulins, and minor components such as lactoferrin,                                      lactoperoxidase (EC 1. 11. 1.7) and various growth factors.                                      Many of these components possess immunobiological properties                                      (Ogra &amp; Ogra, 1978; Juto, 1985; Stoeck et al. 1989; Mincheva-Nilsson                                      et al. 1990; Watson. 1990; Barta et al. 1991). It is evident                                      that peptides and the amino acids incorperated in them                                      can influence the immune response in different ways, and                                      minor changes in the dietary amino acid profile may modulate                                      the immune response without significant impact on nutritional                                      status (Belokrylov et al. 1992). Therefore, it is possible                                      that, unique amino acid groups or peptides derived from                                      whey proteins after ingestion may have significant immunomodulatory                                      activities <i>in vivo</i>.                                  </p>                                 <p>Recent evidence suggests that a diet based on whey protein                                      could enhance the IgM plaque-forming cell response in                                      mouse spleen and prevent colon tumour growth in mice when                                      compared with diets containing other protein sources (Bounous                                      et al. 1988a, b). The prophylactic potential of whey proteins                                      against initiation of colon tumours was further supported                                      by a more recent study using a rat model (McIntosh, 1993).                                      In addition, results from a preliminary clinical trial                                      led Bounous et al. (1993) to propose that dietary whey                                      proteins may have beneficial effects in human immunodeficiency                                      virus (HIV)-infected patients. In view of these recent                                      studies, a better understanding of the immunological properties                                      of whey proteins and their underlying mechanisms would                                      be of value in assessing their potential clinical or pharmaceutical                                      applications. In the present study we have investigated                                      the effects of dietary bovine milk whey protein concentrate                                      on both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in                                      mice.                                 </p>                                 <p> <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b> </p>                                 <p><i>Mice</i> <br />                                     Female BALB/c mice, 8-10 weeks old, were obtained from                                      the CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering (North                                      Ryde, NSW 2113).                                  </p>                                 <p><i>Diets </i><br />                                     Several experimental approaches were used to evaluate                                      the effects of dietary whey proteins on immune responses                                      in mice.
