        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Data</strong></p>
        <p>Any time you visit this website ("Site"), we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site and where you go on our Site. This information may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address, and any search engine you may have used to locate the site. We may use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site, and compile broad statistical data.</p>
        <p><strong>Information Voluntarily Provided</strong></p>
        <p>Any information you provide to us (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.) when you request information, or use any of the other interactive portions of our websites, is securely maintained on our web server and internal systems. This information may be used to provide you with information you've requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices. You may opt out of receiving future communications at any time (see Opt-Out Procedures below).</p>
        <p><strong>Information Collected from Other Sources</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>Information about our Site visitors is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We may share your information only as described below and with subsidiaries that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Partners</strong></p>
        <p>We may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times to provide expanded services to our Site visitors. As part of such a relationship, we may share with these companies the use of certain interactive Site functions. Information provided by our Site visitors through the use of such interactive functions may be available to both us and our partners.</p>
        <p><strong>Agents</strong></p>
        <p>We may use other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf (e.g., administering e-mail services). Such parties only have access to the personal information needed to perform these functions and may not use or store the information for any other purpose. You should not receive unsolicited e-mail messages from agents working on our behalf.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
        <p>In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, Site visitor information will most likely be one of the transferred assets.

        <p><strong>Compliance with Law/Safety</strong></p>
        <p>We may disclose specific personal information based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company, along with its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliated and/or related companies.</p>
        <p><strong>With Your Consent</strong></p>
        <p>Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when any personally identifiable information about you may be shared with third parties, and you will be given the opportunity to decline to share that information.</p>
