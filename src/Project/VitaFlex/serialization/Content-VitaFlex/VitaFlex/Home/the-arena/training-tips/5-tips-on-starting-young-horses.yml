The process is involved, but Adrienne identifies the five aspects she&nbsp;believes&nbsp;are most important when working with young horses.&nbsp;</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">1.</span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Be Clear.</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp; Make sure that the horse has a clear understanding of what every aid means. That means riders must be precise with the cues they give. Riders need to spend as much time developing their own skills as they do teaching the horse. Ideally, the rider should have the skills to recognize when a horse's response to the cue was correct or not. Doing so allows the rider to quickly correct or reward the horse's effort.</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">2.</span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Keep it simple.</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;Minimize the amount of information given to the horse until it is&nbsp;confident&nbsp;with the aids it has been taught thus far. Teaching too many cues at once can frustrate a horse.&nbsp;Keeping it simple nurtures confidence,&nbsp;which&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;the horse to try harder the next time.</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">3.</span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Think like a horse.</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;Horses&nbsp;have emotions too. Try to&nbsp;place yourself if your horse's shoes and think about how he would interpret what you're asking. Most times, horses don't want to make mistakes. Disobedience is often the result of confusion or frustration.&nbsp;Take a second and stop to think about what the horse is misunderstanding and why, so you can better explain it to them.&nbsp;Don't let your feelings of frustration bubble over. Sometimes it's better to take a&nbsp;short&nbsp;break and come back after you've had time to think things through.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">4.</span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Keep work sessions short</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun">.&nbsp; Set specific goals that are small enough to accomplish in each training session. Never let the horse get to a point where they are too tired physically to be able to do what you’re asking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">Pushing a young horse too hard for too long is the fastest way to create resistance and to make a horse stop trying. The horse must learn to trust the fact that the rider will never ask more of them than they are physically capable of delivering at that moment. A young horse must&nbsp;also&nbsp;learn that if they focus and try hard, they will not be drilled. When the horse believes this, they will willingly try to do whatever the rider asks of them</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="normaltextrun">5.</span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Make training fun.&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun">&nbsp;Change up the exercise routine.
