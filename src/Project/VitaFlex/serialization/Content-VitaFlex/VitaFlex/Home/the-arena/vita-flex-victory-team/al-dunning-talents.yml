He’s already a&nbsp;million-dollar&nbsp;rider in reining and now he’s closing in on the same title in cutting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Al Dunning is one of the most respected horsemen in the horse industry. He’s most widely known for his dominance in&nbsp;reining&nbsp;and his status as an Equi-Stat Million Dollar Rider.&nbsp;Now he’s&nbsp;striving&nbsp;to earn equal status&nbsp;in the cutting pen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“That’s my focus right now. My goal is to become a&nbsp;million-dollar&nbsp;cutting rider too,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For those who don’t know Al, cutting may seem like a recent addition. However, it’s a discipline he’s very familiar with. In 1988, he won the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) senior cutting world championship aboard More Oats Please a horse that he raised and trained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“I like doing it all. I’m a busy guy and like working hard. I get bored doing just one thing,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>When he’s not training horses or clients, he and Becky,&nbsp;his wife of 47 years,&nbsp;can be found at the family’s cabin that overlooks Big Spirit Lake in Iowa.&nbsp;Turns out he’s as much an accomplished fly fisher as he is a horse trainer.&nbsp;</p> <p>To date, he’s won&nbsp;four master angler awards for catching 30-inch rainbow trout with a little bitty&nbsp;fly, he said. Those awards compliment his honors in the horse industry that include an AQHA&nbsp;Professional Horseman of the Year, the NCHA Zane Schulte Trainer of the Year, Monte Roberts&nbsp;Equitarian&nbsp;award,&nbsp;<em>Western Horseman Magazine's Western Horseman Award</em>.&nbsp;He and his students have collectively won&nbsp;48 World and Reserve World&nbsp;Championship titles.&nbsp;Until recently, he&nbsp;also&nbsp;chaired the&nbsp;AQHA&nbsp;judge’s committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“The cabin was owned by Becky’s grandmother and we love spending summer there where we’re out of the Arizona heat,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>As competitive as he is, the lifelong horseman&nbsp;enjoys playing a golf. It’s a sport he can play without feeling the pressure to win.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I got to be really good at the horse thing and I enjoy golf because I don’t have to be as competitive,” he said. “It’s a super hobby.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Al isn’t riding or coaching clients at his Scottsdale, Arizona&nbsp;Almosta&nbsp;Ranch, he’s helping riders&nbsp;virtually achieve their goals. His online training program Team Al Dunning allows individuals to submit videos of them riding. He responds with voice over&nbsp;guidance on how to improve.&nbsp;</p> <p>“It’s like having a professional lesson anywhere in the world,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although Al has become a legend in the western performance industry, including having trained Expensive Hobby a 1971 gelding that was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2007, he considers his greatest achievements to be his family. He has&nbsp;two children,&nbsp;daughter McKenzie and son Grady, and two granddaughters.&nbsp;</p> <p>“They are the love of my life,” he said.”&nbsp;</p> <p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
