        <p>Professional barrel racer Jackie Ganter hauls nearly 60,000 miles to compete in almost 100 rodeos each year with her&nbsp;four&nbsp;horses. That equates to a lot of hours behind the wheel, many of them late at night. She says traveling with her mom, Angela who is also a competitive barrel racer, makes the hectic schedule easier.&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="" height="533" width="400" src="-/media/BEBC11CE717446E092D69A2401A45B57.ashx?h=533&amp;w=400" /></p> <p>&ldquo;We talk about everything when we&rsquo;re on the road,&rdquo; Jackie says. &ldquo;I also like to listen to audiobooks, especially murder mysteries.&nbsp;I also really like Rachel Hollis&rsquo; book &ldquo;Girl, Wash Your Face&rdquo; (2018). Energy drinks keep me going late at night.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The spring and summer rodeo season&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;Jackie on the road for weeks at a time. She only gets back to her home in Abilene, Texas if she flies back for a few days. Her travel takes her across the United States and into Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m home I ride young horses and train and when I&rsquo;m&nbsp;gone,&nbsp;I do touristy things,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;&ldquo;My favorite place to visit is&nbsp;Banff&nbsp;in&nbsp;Alberta, Canada. It&rsquo;s less than two hours from Calgary&nbsp;where we compete so&nbsp;it&rsquo;s an easy day trip.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The 22-year-old enjoyed a successful youth career winning both the All-American Youth Barrel Racing Championship and the 2015 Texas High School Rodeo State Barrel Racing Championship. She graduated high school a year early to become a professional and run barrels full time. She obtained her Women&rsquo;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) card in 2015 and&nbsp;won the&nbsp;WPRA&rsquo;s Rookie of the Year&nbsp;that year,&nbsp;becoming one of the youngest riders to earn the title. She&rsquo;s also qualified for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) and the Canadian National Finals twice.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;It was indescribable to win the rookie of the year,&rdquo;&nbsp;she says. &ldquo;It was a dream that was years in the making and to accomplish it was something I&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The young professional has enjoyed tremendous success in her short career. Nothing replaces hard work and grit but she says that she&rsquo;s superstitious. For example, she won&rsquo;t trade in her hat. She first started wearing it in 2014 and it&rsquo;s been rained on and stepped on more than once but it&rsquo;s the only hat she&rsquo;s worn on the professional rodeo circuit, and she has no plans for replacing it. She&rsquo;s also particular about the tack she uses; she uses the same saddle pads and horse boots for every race.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;My stuff is my stuff. I stick to a plan and a routine, and I don&rsquo;t like that to be interrupted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If my mom uses&nbsp;something&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been winning in,&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;freak out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Claiming a spot&mdash;and staying on the WPRA&rsquo;s standings&mdash;each year is not for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of hard work and late nights. But it&rsquo;s a lifestyle that&rsquo;s worth the sacrifices, she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;My favorite saying is be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The rodeo life is tough but it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
