Julia Gloviczki, an ambulatory veterinarian at Rood &amp; Riddle in Saratoga, New York often sees buyers decide based on the horse&rsquo;s selling price.</p> <p>&ldquo;The price tag on the horse is the cheapest part of the investment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the hook for costs as long as you keep the horse.&rdquo;</p> <p>A pre-purchase exam establishes a baseline for the horse&rsquo;s health at a specific point in time. It gives buyers as much knowledge as possible about the horse they are about to purchase.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever pass or fail a horse,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is not my job to tell you to buy the horse or not. It&rsquo;s my job to tell you everything I can about its health and wellness at that point in time.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Equine pre-purchase checklist</h2> <p>Dr. Gloviczki begins all pre-purchase exams with a physical evaluation where she:</p> <ul>     <li>Looks at the eyes for cataracts</li>     <li>Listens to the heart, gut, and lungs</li>     <li>Feels for swelling, scars, or joint disjunction</li> </ul> <p>Next, she performs a <a href="https://dressagetoday.com/horse-health-/flexion-test-25486">flexion test</a> and:</p> <ul>     <li>Watches the horse jog in-hand to look for discomfort</li>     <li>Repeats on hard and soft surfaces when possible</li>     <li>Observe the horse working on the lunge line and under saddle when possible</li> </ul> <p>&ldquo;The clinical exam is the most important part of a pre-purchase,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is a good rule of thumb to have somebody say the horse is sound today, doesn&rsquo;t have heart murmurs or signs of cataracts.</p> <h2>An equine drug screen</h2> After the physical exam, Dr. Gloviczki encourages a <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/news/toxicology-equine-drug-screening-update-0">drug screen</a> to check for anti-inflammatories and long-term sedation. <p>&ldquo;I especially look for long-term sedation for a kid or amateur friendly horse. I want to know the horse is not under influence of any drugs,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>A drug screen also protects sellers. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a horse to behave differently after it&rsquo;s bought from a professional or experienced horse person. Buyers sometimes claim the horse was drugged when changes in diet, training, and the environment are to blame. In this situation, a drug screen protects the seller.</p> <h2>An inside look</h2> <p>X-rays are standard practice in racehorses and high-dollar performance horses. The flexion test and the buyer&rsquo;s goals determine if only a handful of images are needed or if extensive images are needed to see every joint in the legs.</p> <p>&ldquo;The horse may be perfectly sound on the day of the exam but if a cyst shows up in the stifle, I can make certain predictions about the future lack of soundness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t ride x-rays.&rdquo;</p> <p>A 15-year-old horse may be clinically sound and have a multitude of imperfections on x-rays. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s unable to perform as a lesson horse. X-rays may also reveal a young prospect is unlikely to remain sound for its chosen discipline.</p> <h2>Cost of a pre-purchase exam</h2> <p>Prices for pre-purchase exams varies geographically and based on what is included.</p> <p>These are estimates for a starting point only:<br /> Physical exam: $200<br /> Drug screen: $150 to $400<br /> X-rays: $200 to $2,000+ based on needs</p> <h2>Three real-life experiences</h2> <p>Paying for a pre-purchase exam comes down to the buyer&rsquo;s choice. Here are three horse owners' experiences.</p> <h3>Buyer beware</h3> <p>Upstate New York western pleasure competitor CharlieAnne Huffam found a 3-year-old that fit her competitive goals and she asked for a pre-purchase exam.</p> <p>&ldquo;When the vet asked for his papers, the trainer started fumbling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The vet knew he wasn't three by looking at his teeth. He was four. During the flexion test, he was off on one of his fronts.&rdquo;</p> <p>Huffam declined the purchase deciding not to invest in additional costs for x-rays to explore lameness issues in a young horse that did not meet her needs. Instead, she continued her search.</p> <h3>Seller protection</h3> A pre-purchase exam protects the seller as much as the buyer. Hammond, Wisconsin rider Hannah Schreck advertised a 3-year-old barrel racing prospect and the buyer requested x-rays. The horse wasn&rsquo;t lame and the x-ray revealed joint spacing that wouldn&rsquo;t hold up to concussive events over time. <p>&ldquo;The buyer spent around $500 but it saved her from bringing up a young horse that would have a short career and us from selling a horse they wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with,&rdquo; Schreck said. &ldquo;We then knew how we needed to advertise the horse&mdash;for trail riding.&rdquo;</p> <h3>Passing on the pre-purchase exam</h3> <p>Westfield, New Jersey horse owner Heather Wallace opted out of a pre-purchase exam twice. She and her trainer knew the horses and were aware of the pony&rsquo;s history that the thoroughbred would not pass a flexion test.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have a team of wellness professionals I work with as colleagues to help me, as well as my own expertise in musculature and anatomy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I rescued the thoroughbred from a bad situation, I focused on rebuilding his foundation so that the pressure is off his hocks and he will be better than before. I only plan on using him for trail riding and hunter paces rather than show jumping like he was being trained to do.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Conflict of interest</h2> <p>Hiring a veterinarian that is not associated with the horse&rsquo;s care eliminates the possibility of conflict of interest. When Dr. Gloviczki has a client selling a horse she only agrees to do the pre-purchase exam if the seller allows full disclosure.</p> <p>&ldquo;If I knew I injected hocks and then I&rsquo;m looking at two weeks later to sell to somebody else that could be a problem,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Finding an independent veterinarian in rural areas may be challenging. In these cases, Dr. Gloviczki encourages buyers to request the release of the horse&rsquo;s full medical history. If the seller is unwilling, it is probably something to think about.</p> <p>Requesting a pre-purchase exam may feel like you&rsquo;re doubting the seller. Having as much information about the horse up-front can help determine if the horse is the right one.</p>
