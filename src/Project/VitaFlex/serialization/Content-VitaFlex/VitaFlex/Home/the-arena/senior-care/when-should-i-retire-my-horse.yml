        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Vet with horse owner examining senior horse" src="-/media/86CFD836ADDA4918A26C7CD4C786C6C8.ashx?h=480&amp;w=720" style="width: 720px; height: 480px;" />&nbsp;</p> <p>Humans have defined retirement goals. For some, it&rsquo;s age 55 or 62. For others, it&rsquo;s a milestone&mdash;typically 20 or 30 years. It isn&rsquo;t as cut and dry with horses. Neither age nor years under saddle are good predictors of an ideal retirement age, according to veterinarian <span>Reynolds Cowles, founder of Blue Ridge Equine Clinic in Earlysville, Virginia.</span></p> <p>&ldquo;The primary factor is the condition of the animal for the purpose it is being used for,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are horses that are useful well into their 20s and other younger horses with musculoskeletal or other health issues that can&rsquo;t be used.&rdquo;</p> <p>Lameness is the most common reason horses are retired. Lingering soreness from an injury or a condition that develops from wear or tear may necessitate a lighter workload. Rather than targeting an achievement, Dr. Cowles suggests watching for indications a horse is struggling at his current level of performance.</p> <p>A show ring hunter who repeatedly swaps leads before a jump, or who misses lead changes, or is sore on a landing, may be showing signs that his current job is too strenuous. Barrel horses reluctant to lay down around a barrel or cutting horses not as eager to work as hard as they once did may be candidates for a change.</p> <p>Dr. Cowles advises that when something isn&rsquo;t right, call your veterinarian and ask for a thorough evaluation. A full workup may show that a horse simply needs to have proper treatment for a health issue, dropped back in intensity rather than turned out on pasture.</p> <p>&ldquo;Consider what the horse can do. Keeping a horse in light work is often better for joint issues. Some horses struggle more with complete turnout than staying in light work,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Rest is always an important factor in treatment. Whether that rest is temporary or long term, it can help a horse recover.&rdquo;</p> <p>A physical examination may also reveal health conditions such as metabolic syndrome or <span>Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction, also known as Equine Cushings disease, that may be the underlying cause of the change in performance. These conditions and others don&rsquo;t have to mean the end of a horse&rsquo;s career. Proper treatment and long-term management changes can mean the horse is still able to perform. Unlike lameness or injury, a horse won&rsquo;t limp or appear sore in these cases. But it may be difficult to maintain weight and there may be a change in the horse&rsquo;s hair texture and length.</span></p> <p><span>When the time comes that your horse can no longer perform at the same level, your goals and finances will determine what happens next.</span> <span>Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) often allow a horse to stay at the same level of competition&nbsp;when dosage levels comply with the rules of the event. Therapeutic shoeing is also an option.</span></p> <p><span>Lesson programs and families with less experienced riders in their ranks may be able to successfully continue riding the horse at a slower pace. Seasoned horses can also make good babysitters for young colts settling in at home or on the road. Leases are also viable alternatives. Even if you&rsquo;re able to keep a horse and he&rsquo;s unable to work, don&rsquo;t neglect the basics. Even retired horses need dental care, good nutrition and regular visits from both the farrier and veterinarian.</span></p> <p><span>For horse owners who don&rsquo;t have these options, Dr. Cowles encourages riders to leverage their network to find a suitable new home.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Someone may simply be looking for a companion horse. Veterinarians, farriers, local extension agents and folks at the feed store are all great resources,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Therapeutic programs are always looking for quiet horses. Those horses just walk around and the programs are often very suitable for retired horses.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>A retirement farm might be a great option for some horse owners. Many of these farms provide horses with shelter and turnout&nbsp;at a lower price&nbsp;than typical boarding facilities.&nbsp;Some breed and competitive organizations have affiliated non-profit organizations designed to help rehome horses. The Standardbred Retirement Foundation, The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation and </span><span>the USHJA Equine Retirement Facilities List and the are just a few examples or organizations designed to help horses transition out of a previous career.</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://aaep.org/guidelines/rescue-and-retirement">"</a></span><a href="https://aaep.org/guidelines/rescue-and-retirement"><span>Care Guidelines for Equine Retirement Facilities</span></a><span><a href="https://aaep.org/guidelines/rescue-and-retirement">&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;is a helpful resource for finding the right fit.</span><span></span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;In searching for a retirement facility, check carefully for their history,&rdquo; he concludes. &ldquo;Many groups begin with good intentions but run into financial difficulties and horse care may not be adequate.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Retiring a horse is not always an easy decision. Communicating with your horse&rsquo;s health care team&mdash;veterinarians, farriers and others&mdash;can help keep your horse working longer and more comfortably, even at a lower level. And when the time comes when your horse has earned full&nbsp;retirement, remember it&rsquo;s important to keep up with routine hoof and health care.</span></p>
