        <p>Maintaining soundness in the equine athlete is an ongoing task for those involved in the horse industry. Soundness depends on a horse&rsquo;s muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones and joints functioning in concert. Joint function is related to motion, controlled by muscles and tendons in a way that is repeatable with low friction and, as such, during normal training and competition should be without inflammation or joint soreness.  Combating the causes of lameness, inflammation and soreness with a preventative approach helps keep your horse at peak performance.</p>

        <h2>Studies Show How Supplement Combinations Can Maintain Healthy Joints</h2>
        <p>The use of oral glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate in different combinations as joint protectants has been researched intensively over the past two decades, as has these supplements' ability to reduce inflammation and soreness associated with everyday training and competition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dechant, et al. (2005) showed that a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate worked better than either alone in reducing glycosaminoglycans in performance horses.</li>
            <li>Harlan, Haut and Orth (2011) showed that the addition of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate reduced release of nitric oxide and glycosaminoglycans.</li>
            <li>M.R. Rogers (2006) reported that oral intake of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate extended the time required between use in the distal intertarsal and tarso-metatarsal joints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Glucosamine works as a supplement because cartilage readily absorbs this substance. Chondroitin sulfate can also be absorbed after oral administration. These supplements and others that can be absorbed, such as hyaluronic acid, can work in concert to provide targeted joint support and promote joint health at the cellular level. </p>
        <h2>Healthy Joints &amp; Equinyl&trade; Supplement</h2>

        <p>Daily training and competition can cause joints to become sore or inflamed and for high level competitors, keeping joints healthy is critical for success. Vita Flex has fine-tuned its joint supplements, tested them in a lab and the real world and fine-tuned them some more to help keep performance horse's competing at a top level.</p>
        <p>Vita Flex Victory Team members like Todd Minikus rely on products like Equinyl&trade; Combo with Hyaluronic Acid to maintain healthy joints in his performance horses.  One key differentiator in some of the products in the Equinyl&trade; line is that they not only have traditional glucosamine but also contain 20% patent-pending time-release glucosamine, which continuously releases for over 24 hours to ensure that the synovial fluid in joints is available to lubricate joints all day.  Additionally, inflammation is a byproduct of heavy training and competition.  Vita Flex&rsquo;s patented ComfortX&trade; ingredients are designed to reduce inflammation caused by normal daily exercise and provide joint health support with flexibility and rapid recovery time.</p>
        <p>Equinyl&trade; products and HylaMotion&trade; powder are parts of the full line of Vita Flex<sup>&reg;</sup> products designed with the performance horse in mind, to keep your high performance horses healthy and in top condition.
