He shares five tips for bringing along futurity prospects that are physically fit and mentally sound.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>One step at a time</strong>.&nbsp;A finished futurity horse isn’t made over night. It’s a steady process that is incrementally built one day at a time. He encourages riders to strive for a one percent improvement each day. At the end of 100 days, that’s 100 percent advancement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“You never want to be too hard on a young horse,” he said.&nbsp;“It&nbsp;can quickly burn them out.”&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Rider correctness.&nbsp;</strong>The focus is often on the horse responding to a rider’s cues correctly. However, Al says that it has as much to do with the rider’s cues as the horse’s response.&nbsp;</p> <p>“What&nbsp;the rider does with their legs, hands and upper body impacts the horse’s training,” he said.&nbsp;“Many riders tend to pick up and pull on the reins, when it’s actually the opposite that’s needed. Riders actually need to pull the reins as little as possible.”&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Ride slow.&nbsp;</strong>A rider can get a whole lot done at the walk and trot, Al said. He thinks that the best way to get to the horse’s mind is by going slower, not faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Most people tend to quicken their hands and feet,” he said. “Anytime I feel confusion in a horse I slow down and go back to the basics that they are most comfortable and confident doing.”&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Consistency</strong>. This is key for horses of any age, but especially for young horses just starting out in training.&nbsp;Each horse is an individual, but if given a consistent and repetitive program, the horse will come around and become the best it can be, he said. The ultimate goal&nbsp;for any futurity horse is to&nbsp;achieve the best&nbsp;it&nbsp;possibly can with the&nbsp;mindset, conformation and soundness&nbsp;it was born with.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Pick the right coach.</strong>&nbsp;Al believes it takes two sets of eyes to train a horse. A coach,&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;is skilled enough to give constructive&nbsp;feedback, help horse and rider advance more quickly.&nbsp;And he says that’s as true for&nbsp;amateurs&nbsp;and non-pros as it is for professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>"You have to be humble enough to ask for help,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>A second set of eyes is beneficial in any discipline, but especially for reined cow horse events. For those who are new to the discipline he recommends a horse that already has experience in each of the events.&nbsp;</p> <p>“If the rider is green or a rookie, they need a horse that’s safe and knows how to perform in each event. Those horses are hard to find. They sell fast because everybody wants one,” he said.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
