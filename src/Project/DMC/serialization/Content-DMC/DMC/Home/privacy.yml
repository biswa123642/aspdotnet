        we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the

        information may include the type and version of your browser, your service
        provider, your IP address, and any search engine you may have used to

        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">
        Information Voluntarily Provided
        </h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Any information you provide to us (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.) when
        you request information, or use any of the other interactive portions of
        our Web sites, is securely maintained on our Web server and internal
        systems. This information may be used to provide you with information
        you've requested about our company, our products and our services, or to
        provide you with special notices. You may opt out of receiving future
        communications at any time (see Opt-Out Procedures below).
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Information Collected from Other Sources</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        We may in the future receive information about you from other sources. We
        will maintain any such information in accordance with the standards set
        forth in this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        Information about our Web Site visitors is an important part of our
        business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We may
        share your information only as described below and with subsidiaries that
        either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as
        protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Business Partners</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        We may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times
        to provide expanded services to our Web Site visitors. As part of such a
        relationship, we may share with these companies the use of certain
        interactive Web Site functions. Information provided by our Web Site
        visitors through the use of such interactive functions may be available to
        both us and our partners.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Agents</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        We may use other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on
        our behalf (e.g., administering e-mail services). Such parties only have
        access to the personal information needed to perform these functions and
        may not use or store the information for any other purpose. You should not
        receive unsolicited e-mail messages from agents working on our behalf.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Business Transfers</h3>
        <p style="z-index: 1;">
        In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, Web
        Site visitor information will most likely be one of the transferred assets.
        However, such transferred information will remain subject to the terms of
        any pre-existing Privacy Policy of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">Compliance with Law/Safety</h3>

        rights, property, or safety of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company, along with
        its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliated and/or related companies.
        </p>
        <h3 style="z-index: 1;">With Your Consent</h3>

        parties, and you will be given the opportunity to decline to share that
        information.
