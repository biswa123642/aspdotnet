        <p>The first thing you will need to do is measure your dog.  Measure them from the tip of the nose to the tail.  Take that measurement and add about 6 inches to it.  That total is how long your bed new pet bed should measure. Then measure your dog from shoulder to shoulder at the widest point.  Take that measurement and add about 6 inches to it as well.  That total is how wide your pet bed should be.  For example, if your dog measures 20&rdquo; long and 10&rdquo; wide, you want your bed to measure at least 26&rdquo; x 16&rdquo;.  This method will give your dog plenty of room the sprawl out when needed. When undecided between two sizes, buy one that is a bit too large rather than a bit too small.  Below is a general guide if you are unable to measure your pet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Small beds are typically no bigger than 21&rdquo; and cater to puppies and smaller dogs up to 20 lbs.</li>
            <li>Medium beds typically fall between 22&rdquo;-34&rdquo; and cater to dogs up to 40 lbs.</li>
            <li>Medium/Large Pillow beds start at 27&rdquo;x36&rdquo; in size while larger box beds usually top out at 36&rdquo;.  These beds are designed to accommodate dogs up to 60 lbs.</li>
            <li>Large rectangular style beds start at 30&rdquo;x40&rdquo; in size and are designed to accommodate dogs up to 80 lbs.</li>
            <li>Extra Large rectangular style beds such as a 40&rdquo;x50&rdquo; are designed to accommodate dogs up to 100 lbs.</li>
