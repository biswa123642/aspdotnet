        <p><strong>Chopped Memory Foam </strong>- This is the next step up from fiber fill as an economical blend of ground up foam and memory foam are mixed to create a chopped foam mix. The reason a mix is required is that memory foam is far too sticky and therefore would clump together if not mixed with traditional foam.  A very firm mattress type of effect can be achieved by using chopped foam, especially when used in conjunction with a chambered or baffled style liner.  Typically, not recommended for machine washing as foam absorbs water causing the foam to clump and lengthy dry times.</p>
        <p><strong>Orthopedic Foam </strong>- This type of foam is also referred to as &ldquo;egg crate&rdquo; foam due to the peak and valley type of construction.  Orthopedic foam helps to improve blood circulation and is therefore great for older dogs or dogs that have a predisposition to hip and joint problems. Most orthopedic foam should not be machine washed as the foam can twist and get out of shape during the wash cycle and thus ruin the pet bed.</p>
        <p><strong>Gel Memory Foam</strong> - This is the highest quality of foam traditionally used in pet beds as it contours to a pet&rsquo;s body and can also be treated with chemicals to give it a &ldquo;cooling&rdquo; property.  This type of foam is also not recommended for machine washing as it can twist and gnarl very easily during the wash cycle.
