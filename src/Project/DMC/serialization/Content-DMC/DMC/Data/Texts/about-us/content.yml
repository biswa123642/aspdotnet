        <h3>At Dallas Manufacturing Company we've been making pets more comfortable since 1988.</h3>
        <p>Although DMC started as a seasonal sporting goods manufacturing company; the love and passion for our pets and the growing demand for stylish quality pet beds has made us who we are today. We are the largest manufacturer of pet beds in North America, with year-round employees in our 4 manufacturing facilities across the USA. Using furniture grade fabrics and premium fill has made out pet beds some of the highest quality beds on the market.</p>
        <p>You may be asking yourself, why have I not heard of a company that has been making pet beds for so long? The answer is simple, for decades we have been the leader in something called "private label". Private label is a product manufactured or packaged for sale under the name of the retailer rather than that of the manufacturer. Major retailers have trusted in our innovation, design, and quality to make their branded pet beds for decades. There is a pretty good chance that if you have purchased a high-quality retail store branded pet bed, you may have purchased a DMC pet bed. you just don't see our name.
        With the growing eCommerce market, we have recently developed a full line of brands that are available to you through our online partners. The next tine you are looking at a store brand pet bed, take a look at the sewn in in label on the cover to see where it is make. If it says Athens, TX, Central Garden &amp; Pet, Or Dallas Manufacturing; you're the proud owner of one of our beds</p>
        <p>
        Whether your pet is large or small likes to stretch out or curl up, our brands create beds with your pets in mind.
        </p>
