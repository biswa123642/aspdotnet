        <p><strong>Insect Growth Regulators and Naturals</strong></p>
        <p>You can feel comfortable using insect growth regulators (IGRs) and naturals for complete mosquito control in clients’ backyards, patios, and open spaces. Altosid &nbsp;larvicides are IGRs that prevents adult emergence by suspending mosquito development at the pupal stage, leading to death due to age or predation. The active ingredient, (S)-Methoprene, has an excellent LD50 profile resulting in low environmental impact with no bioaccumulation. Naturals are botanically based insecticides (or 25b Exempt)that offer natural adult mosquito control for the environmentally conscious consumer. The Essentria®&nbsp;line up sprays and concentrates use active ingredients that include rosemary oil, peppermint oil, geraniol, clove oil, and thyme oil that can be applied with little to no risk to humans or the environment.</p>
