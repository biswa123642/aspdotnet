        </h1>
        <p>We’re seeing PMPs across the country add ExciteR™ 55 to their toolbox for its flexible usage and fast-acting results. One customer noted, “This product is awesome! Used for a German roach clean out. Used less than a quarter of the contents and had immediate kills. Talked to clients 7 days later and no roach activity was seen, except dead ones. Highly impressed.”
        Read more about all of the benefits of ExciteR™ 55, including a flip-up nozzle and synergized formulation.</p>
