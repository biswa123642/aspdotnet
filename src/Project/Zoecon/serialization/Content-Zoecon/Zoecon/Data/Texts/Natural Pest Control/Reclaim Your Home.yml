        <h1>Reclaim Your Home from Insects with Natural Pest Control</h1>
        <p>The quest for safer alternatives to insect control has led us back to the natural methods of the past. By combining botanical knowledge that has been passed down through generations with modern-day chemistries, the experts behind the Essentria<span>®</span>&nbsp;line are able to create safer, effective and natural insecticides from essential oils when used as directed.</p>
        <p>There are many advantages to the softer chemistries featured in botanical pest control. These essential-oil insect control products are ideal for residential applications as they pose little to no threat to humans and animals. This is because they work by exploiting the natural strengths of plants and the natural weaknesses of insects, making pests less likely to develop resistance.</p>
        <p>Unlike most pesticides, which use synthetic chemicals, Essentria<span>®</span>&nbsp;botanical insecticides utilize essential oils that are naturally derived from plants to create kid friendly, pet friendly and eco friendly pest control products. In comparison to synthetic pesticides, botanical pesticides break down much more quickly, delivering a more environmentally friendly solution.</p>
        <p>The Essentria<span>®</span>&nbsp;line of products is highly effective at getting the job done against a variety of indoor and outdoor pests, including ants, mosquitoes and ticks.</p>
