        <h3>1968</h3>
        <p>Zoëcon was founded by Dr. Carl Djerassi, where his team was able to commercially produce a group of molecules called insect growth regulators (IGRs) which revolutionized insect control by introducing a method that interferes with the development and reproduction of insects. Beginning with methoprene, and the later discovery of hydroprene and kinoprene, these compounds became the building blocks of the comprehensive Zoëcon<span style="line-height: 0;">®&nbsp;</span>portfolio of insect control solutions.</p>
