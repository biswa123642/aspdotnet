        <p style="text-align: left;">Take your lawn and landscape management business to the next level by expanding your service offering with botanical pest control solutions from the Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> line. By combining botanical knowledge that has been passed down through generations with modern-day chemistries, the experts behind the Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> line are able to create safer, effective and natural insecticides from essential oils when used as directed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">These essential-oil insect control products are ideal for residential applications as they pose little to no threat to humans and animals. They can also be used in nearly any commercial application as they are 25(b) Exempt products with no label restrictions. This is because they work by exploiting the natural strengths of plants and the natural weaknesses of insects, making pests less likely to develop resistance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Unlike most pesticides, which use synthetic chemicals, Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> botanical insecticides utilize essential oils that are naturally derived from plants to create kid friendly, pet friendly and eco-friendly pest control products your customers are seeking. In comparison to synthetic pesticides, botanical pesticides break down much more quickly, delivering a more environmentally friendly solution.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> line of products is highly effective at getting the job done against a variety of pests, including ants, mosquitoes and ticks.</p>
