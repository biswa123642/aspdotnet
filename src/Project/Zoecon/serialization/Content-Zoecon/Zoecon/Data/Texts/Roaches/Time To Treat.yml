        <h2>Time to treat!</h2>
        <p>Gentrol<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;products featuring the IGR (S)-hydroprene, have delivered responsible solutions for cockroach control and more with bottom line results you can see since 1984.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the easiest solution is to utilize an aerosol formulation and spray directly on the problem site. That’s why the expert team that brings you Zoëcon products developed two different formulations of Gentrol<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;products in an aerosol form. Easy and convenient to carry, apply these solutions as spot treatments or as a broadcast spray where cockroaches crawl and hide, especially on hidden surfaces for effective cockroach control. Treatments become quick, simple and painless.</p>
