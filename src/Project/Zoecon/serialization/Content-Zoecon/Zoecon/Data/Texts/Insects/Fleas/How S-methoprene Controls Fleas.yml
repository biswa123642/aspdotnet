        <h2>How (S)-methoprene Controls Fleas</h2>
        <p>Precor®&nbsp;products are formulated with the core active ingredient, (S)-methoprene. This IGR, developed by experts at Zoecon, has been used for more than 45 years by pest control and public health professionals to prevent fleas from developing into breeding, biting adult insects. The IGR penetrates and migrates deep into places like the base of carpet fibers and between furniture cushions to prevent the pre-adult flea you don’t see. (S)-Methoprene stops the development of immature fleas into adults, thus breaking the flea life cycle.</p>
