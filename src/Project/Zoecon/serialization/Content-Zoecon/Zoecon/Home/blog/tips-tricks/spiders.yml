Next time you&rsquo;re treating for spiders, follow these three &ldquo;T&rsquo;s&rdquo; to ensure they aren&rsquo;t making their way inside, eliminating callbacks.</p> <p><strong>Teach</strong>: educate customers on the importance of eliminating attractive harborage to spiders as well as the insects they feed on. On the home&rsquo;s exterior, this includes cleaning over-looked areas such as inside and outside of rain gutters (especially near down spouts), as well as outdoor light fixtures near doorways. It&rsquo;s also important to follow proper exclusion practices such as installing screens and door sweeps. On the inside, regularly inspect basements, garages, and attics. </p> <p><strong>Tune-up</strong>: as well as practicing proper cleaning protocol, encourage clients to make repairs around their home to address any remaining spider entry points. This includes patching up and sealing damaged window screens, door sweeps and seals around foundations, and any loose or damaged siding or soffits. </p> <p><strong>Treat</strong>: Using the right product to control spiders is essential for long-lasting and effective results. For a crack-and-crevice treatment, choose a product with a long residual and apply the solution at entry points such as doors, window casings, and eaves. Spiders tend to create webs close to light sources and other areas that attract their prey. Check foyers with outdoor lights as well as garages and treat with a far-reaching spray so you don&rsquo;t have to get very close to get control. Lastly, place sticky traps under furniture to intercept migrating spiders. </p> <p><em>Article originally appeared in PMP Magazine</em> </p>
