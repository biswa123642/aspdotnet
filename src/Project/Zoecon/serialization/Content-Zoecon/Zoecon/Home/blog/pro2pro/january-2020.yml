        <h2> <a name="Southeast">Southeast | Bill Barrs, Drew Lockhart &amp; Walker Mobley</a> </h2> <p><strong>Kick Bed Bugs to the Curb </strong></p> <p> When it comes to treating for bed bugs in hotels, controlling these insects comes with its own set of unique challenges. From the abundance of beds to new visitors checking in daily, there are numerous environmental factors that allow these unwanted guests to thrive. Bed bugs not only put the health of guests and staff at risk, they also harm a hotel’s reputation. The Zoëcon team recently partnered with NeoGuard Pest Solution Services in Orlando, Florida, to learn how bed bugs in hotel rooms can be eliminated by following a comprehensive treatment checklist, consisting of: </p> <ul>     <li>Thorough room inspection     </li>     <li>Properly prepping the room     </li>     <li>Treating with the right products, like those in the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5E99CE444E804AAD822D702A689A42BF&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Zenprox® family</a>     </li>     <li>Performing a 48-hour follow up inspection     </li>     <li>Educating staff on signs to look out for     </li> </ul> <p>For more details, see the comprehensive bed bug treatment checklist in the <a href="-/media/C0C275EBA4E2463896AB8A0BBB9F36B7.ashx" target="_blank">2019 State of the Bed Bug Market.</a> </p>

        <h2><a name="Northeast">Northeast  | Gabe Gliwa</a>  </h2> <p><strong>Controlling Cockroaches in Kitchens </strong></p> <p> The cold weather is here, which means that cockroaches may be seeking food, water, and a place to keep warm inside your clients&rsquo; homes and commercial locations. Remind clients to remove the resources that cockroaches need to survive by inspecting cracks and crevices that are close to water and food sources to make sure all food sources are cleaned up. Properly sealing and storing food is another crucial step clients can take to prevent roaches from surviving through the winter. </p> <p>Cockroaches are extremely resilient, so it&rsquo;s necessary to use the right products to get the job done right without any callbacks. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1F66A0BD4FDB41DCA22A3ADF9A2AFF57&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Gentrol<sup>&reg;</sup> Point Source</a> is a discreet, non-spray roach control device that utilizes a translocating active ingredient to reach hard-to-treat areas.

Makes Fleas Disappear With One Treatment </strong></p> <p> Having a flea infestation in a home is everyone&rsquo;s nightmare, except for the flea. Annoying to both humans and pets, flea populations can explode if left untreated. Female fleas can lay up to 20-30 eggs per day and are able to live up to 100 days. With pre-adult fleas making up 95% of the total flea population, it&rsquo;s important to use a product made to treat these immature fleas. </p> <p>Take advantage of an insect growth regulator like the one found in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7B8E3C76E0EF498495B8D16C5092223D&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Precor<sup>&reg;</sup> products</a> to target and break the life cycle of these pre-adult fleas.

        <h2> <a name="Midwest">Midwest | Mike Leahy &amp; Gary Wagner</a>  </h2> <p><strong>&lsquo;Tis the Season for Overwintering Insects </strong></p> <p> Notice any overwintering insects while putting away holiday decorations? You&rsquo;ve probably already received some calls to treat for overwintering insects, especially in basements and attics. Among overwintering insects, spiders are often times the most commonly found in homes. Spider web removal plays a crucial role in effective spider control. It&rsquo;s important to remove all cobwebs and egg sacs with a vacuum or duster in basements and attics. Once the area is ready for treatment, reach for an aerosol like  Xtend<sup>&reg;</sup>Zenproxto control overwintering insects like spiders, as well as beetles, ants, silverfish, and more.  Xtend<sup>&reg;</sup>Zenproxcombines an IGR with multiple insecticides for immediate control to break the life cycle of insects. This aerosol saves on labor costs by providing knockdown kill with residual and gives PMPs the flexibility to apply as a crack and crevice or spot treatment to areas where pests crawl and hide. </p> <p>To keep the pests from coming back, seal all entryways around doors, windows, utility piping and vents. And when the decorations are all put away, recommend your clients tidy up the storage boxes to reduce clutter spiders seek for harborage.</p>

        <h2> <a name="CentralMountain">Central Mountain | Blaine Oakeson</a>  </h2> <p><strong>The First Step in Ant Protection is Inspection </strong></p> <p> The chilly weather outdoors means PMPs are shifting their focus indoors when controlling ants. Looking for a free meal, ants can often be found crawling around kitchens. Inspecting and prepping kitchens before treatment is a crucial step in ensuring quality control. Remove all pantry items and food sources, and look for ants on the edges of counters and baseboards. PMPs should also be paying close attention to bathrooms when treating for ants. Ants are attracted to the potential food and water sources bathrooms offer like the standing water or hair in drains. Check along the edges of toilets, sinks, bathtubs and pipes for unwanted insect. </p> <p>Once all areas have been inspected and prepped, apply a product like  Xtend Aerosol<sup>®</sup>Zenprox. This easy-to-apply solution combines an IGR with multiple insecticides for extended residual control. The non-staining aerosol provides flexible delivery for efficient control of ants and many other insects.</p>
