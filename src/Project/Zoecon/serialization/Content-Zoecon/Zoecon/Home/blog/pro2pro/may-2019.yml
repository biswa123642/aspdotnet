        <p>As we continue to celebrate more than 50 years of insect control solutions as Zo&euml;con Professional Products, we&rsquo;re honoring more than simply longevity. We&rsquo;re honoring a commitment to public health and wellbeing.</p>
        <p>Zo&euml;con was founded on the discovery of (S)-methoprene, the first insect growth regulator (IGR) utilized in the first environmentally compatible mosquito larvicide. Our founders sought a better way to protect against nuisance and disease spreading insects, and we&rsquo;re honored to carry this vision forward more than 50 years later.</p>
        <p>The team at Zo&euml;con is proud of the comprehensive product line we&rsquo;ve established, including the industry&rsquo;s most versatile offering of botanically based solutions. We continue to build this lineup with innovative new solutions to help you in your job, and we&rsquo;re excited to share our newest addition in the weeks to come.</p>

        <p><strong>RECORD HIGH TICK SEASON ANTICIPATED </strong></p>
        <p>In 2017, reported tick-related diseases grew 22% to 59,349 from the year prior, a record number estimated to be as much five times higher if accurately reported. This reflects a steady rise in the number of tick-borne diseases in recent years that is expected to continue, prompting the CDC to begin monitoring tick populations and disease instances in the United States for the first time.</p>
        <p>The National Pest Management Association predicts 2019 could be among the heaviest tick seasons in years, so develop your control plan. Zo&euml;con offers solutions that include <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8E495F40ACC64AD08D29C997444047E8&amp;_z=z">Mavrik&reg; Perimeter</a>, an easy-to-use barrier treatment that provides immediate knockdown without harming ornamental plants or shrubbery. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BA7BEA48991340CE85F77EF5D75CB756&amp;_z=z">Lambda 9.7 CS</a> is an encapsulated insecticide that will resist breaking down in heat and UV exposure. On the natural control front, consider <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria&reg; IC-3</a>, a FIFRA 25(b) exempt botanical insecticide.</p>
        <p>When applying these products for tick control, use a coarse fan spray to vegetation, brush, branches, rock walls, and other areas near habitation where ticks may harbor or quest. Treat the entire area rather than making spot treatments, and retreat as necessary to maintain control.</p>

        <p><strong>HELP CLIENTS PREPARE FOR FLEA TREATMENTS WITH P.R.E.C.O.R. </strong></p>
        <p>Summer will bring with it peak flea season, and the pest is top of mind on the West Coast with the resurgence in flea-borne diseases in the area. For the most effective and efficient flea application visits, remind customers to follow these helpful steps before you arrive:</p>
        <p><strong>P</strong>ets should be taken out of the area
        <strong>R</strong>ugs, carpets and furniture are vacuumed
        <strong>E</strong>verything is picked up off of the floors
        <strong>C</strong>lean or dispose of all pet bedding
        <strong>O</strong>utdoor spaces are mowed and cleared of items on the ground
        <strong>R</strong>emove all pillows, toys and pet dishes from treatment sites</p>
        <p>Once you arrive, consider treating the home with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7B8E3C76E0EF498495B8D16C5092223D&amp;_z=z">Precor&reg; family</a> of solutions featuring the IGR, (S)-methoprene. This active ingredient penetrates and migrates deep into places like the base of carpet fibers and between furniture cushions to prevent the pre-adult fleas that make up 95% of flea infestation population from maturing into breeding, biting adults.</p>

        <h2> Central Mountain | Blaine Oakeson</h2>
        <p><strong>COLDER, WETTER WINTER COULD MEAN MORE COCKROACHES</strong></p>
        <p>Parts of our region saw a colder and wetter winter than usual, including some with snow in unlikely areas. With a warmer, drier summer to follow, the conditions are right for a heavier than usual population of cockroaches in the region.</p>
        <p>When treating for cockroaches, carefully inspect areas near water in the bathrooms and kitchen. Consider using a mirror for areas that are more difficult to inspect, including under sinks and countertops. Cockroaches can make their way inside through cracks and crevices, sewers, vents and drainpipes, so treat these areas and make sure that all plumbing is properly sealed.</p>
        <p>For effective cockroach control, turn to the trusted and versatile <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E43D88ECC01848CF9D08A7A35ED45AD2&amp;_z=z">Gentrol&reg; line of products</a>. The Gentrol&reg; insect growth regulator, (S)-hydroprene, translocates into hard-to-treat areas and effectively breaks the insect life cycle and offers 120 days of control. Looking for a natural option? Consider the botanically based <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria&reg; IC-3</a> insecticide for immediate knockdown and long residual control of cockroaches.</p>

        <p>With more time being spent outdoors, PMPs can expect calls in the Southeast region for perimeter pests including wasps and ticks. Don&rsquo;t let these pests and other annoying insects ruin your clients&rsquo; time spent in their backyards. Prepare backyards for treatment by inspecting for wasp nests and potential tick habitats to effectively control them at the source. Once nests are identified, use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3CBF6EBDC8DE455FAA9E48152C0360F9&amp;_z=z">Essentria&reg; Wasp &amp; Hornet Spray</a> for immediate kill of these stinging insects. Spraying up to 20 feet away, this solution foams up to control the pest and is approved for use in attics, garages, as well as sensitive areas like schools.

        <p>No one wants to see a fire ant infestation on their property. Delivering a nasty sting, these biting insects can cause real damage to lawns and electrical equipment.

To determine when ants are foraging and achieve the best results, place a crumbled potato chip, corn chips, or other greasy snacks near the mound. If ants do not start to feed on chips within 30 minutes, do not apply the bait. Wait a few days and retest to see if the ants are foraging for protein. Once you see them taking the chips, it&rsquo;s time to apply the bait.</p>

        <p>Mosquito season is here and with a wet winter in the Midwest this year, mosquito breeding sources are plentiful.

Let your clients thoroughly enjoy their time spent outside by preventing mosquitoes from emerging into breeding, biting adults with the Altosid&reg; family of products. Offered in a variety of choices for every need, each Altosid&reg; formulation contains an insect growth regulator that interrupts the mosquito life cycle and depending on the product formulation, residual control activity can range from 7 days all the way up to 150 days.</p>
