        <h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`"></h2><image src="~/media/8ADC54300D9647ACB731FC8A769B0CF5.ashx" /><p>Inspections are important for most pest management professionals, but for Brad Lee, they have become the most important part of finding a solution. As the pest control manager for Arrow Exterminators in Broken Arrow, Okla., Lee says he believes that the key to controlling a cockroach infestation is finding the source, and then treating it with a product that will not only pack a punch, but will also end the pest&rsquo;s life cycle. </p> <p>Thirteen years ago, Lee began working for the family-owned Arrow Exterminators as a pest control technician and first experienced Gentrol products from Zo&euml;con. The more Lee used Gentrol products, the more he realized that these products would be the heavy hitters he had been looking for to take care of difficult cockroach infestations. </p> <p>&ldquo;Gentrol is unmatched in breaking the life cycle of German roaches,&rdquo; Lee says. &ldquo;There is no other product that is as easy to use in any type of account, in my opinion. It is something you can rely on anywhere, and it works.&rdquo; </p> <p>The products feature the insect growth regulator (IGR) (S)-hydroprene, which controls insects by interfering with normal hormone levels during development, preventing further growth. For Lee, this means that he&rsquo;s able to control the infestation before it gets worse. </p> <p>Arrow Exterminators primarily uses the Gentrol Point Source, a cockroach control device that, according to Lee, is ideal to use in areas that you can&rsquo;t spray or fog because of the presence of food. Gentrol Point Source works by using a translocating device that, when activated, can treat an area up to 75 feet. Lee finds this particularly helpful when he&rsquo;s treating commercial kitchens. </p> <p>&ldquo;I rely on Gentrol products daily to make sure that our cockroach treatments are taken care of in a timely manner,&rdquo; Lee says. &ldquo;It is something that is reliable and can be used in areas that are sensitive, something that we use on nearly every roach job.&rdquo;</p> <p></p> <em>Article originally appeared in Pest Management Professional</em>
