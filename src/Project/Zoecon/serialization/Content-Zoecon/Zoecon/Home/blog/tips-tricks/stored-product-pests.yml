With an appetite for rice, flour, cereal, dry pasta, breads and more, these pests can be quite a nuisance. The next time you are treating for stored product pests, follow these three &ldquo;C&rsquo;s&rdquo; to ensure that you get the job done right the first time without callbacks. </p> <ol>     <li><strong>Check the Date.</strong> Infestations tend to increase when food is stored in paper or cardboard containers for long periods of time. Encourage clients to periodically sort through old items in their pantries and to check the expiration dates on packaging. It&rsquo;s best practice to keep pasta, grains and other foods in an airtight, non-cardboard container. </li>     <li><strong>Clean. </strong>In addition to proper food rotation, remind clients to immediately wipe up any crumbs or spills on shelves. Keeping storage areas dry and clean is a necessary practice as moisture increases the likelihood of infestations. If clients keep food in reusable storage containers, remind them to thoroughly clean containers before filling them with new food, as stored product pests can still survive in nearly empty containers. </li>     <li><strong>Control.</strong> Using the right products to control stored product pests is essential for long-lasting and effective results. A combination product featuring an IGR and an insecticide approved for food handling areas will provide powerful control of these pests. If an infestation is found, be sure to also immediately discard the infested food and check surrounding food products for cross-contamination. </li> </ol> <p><em>Article originally appeared in PMP Magazine</em>  </p>
