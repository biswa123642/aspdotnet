        <h2 style="`" z-index:"="" 1;`"=""></h2><image src="~/media/3E37B748D6824B0389754535F7F251FB.ashx"></image><p>There are a lot of unknowns associated with buying a home for the first time. Discerning how to approach pest control is often overlooked by first-time home buyers. Home buyers who have relocated to new regions can face additional challenges as they become familiar with common pests in their area. </p> <p>No matter where you’ve purchased your new home, when it comes to pest control, it’s important to understand the enemy. Many bugs are looking for the same comforts that you are: shelter, food, and water. And they don’t need much of an invitation. Common household pests like ants, for example, can penetrate a home through the tiniest cracks and crevices. </p> <p>At Zoëcon, we’re committed to educating customers about pest control, and beyond that, helping you partner with pest control professionals who will keep your new home protected from unwanted pests.</p> <p>Check out our top tips for new homeowners:</p> <ol>     <li>     <strong>Think Seasonally     </strong>     In many regions, spring and summer are prime time for heavy pest activity, but there are steps you can take throughout the year to reduce that activity. Clearing leaves in the fall, for example, is an important way to reduce space for insect habitats and possible problem areas. Don’t forget to clear gutters and areas around the foundation of the home, especially.</li>     <li>     <strong>Plan for Long-Term Control      </strong>     Shifting from a renter’s perspective to an owner’s perspective extends to all aspects of buying a new home, including pest control. You’re in this for the long haul, so having an insect management strategy that includes residual control products is advised. Ask your pest management professional about long-term control products with insect growth regulators (IGRs), like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E6A41DD368D246F3B6B5FA9947BF4A16&amp;_z=z">Gentrol<sup>®</sup> Complete EC3</a> or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>®</sup> IC-3 Insecticide Concentrate</a>.</li>     <li>     <strong>Schedule a Thorough Inspection      </strong>     Finding a local pest control professional is a great first step toward protecting your new home from pests. With a thorough inspection, you can find out which pests are commonly problematic in your region and learn which steps you should take to mitigate their impact.</li>     <li>     <strong>Cultivate a Partnership with your PMP     </strong>     All productive relationships are built on communication. Cultivating a partnership with your pest management professional is no different. Your PMP will be able to tell you what to look out for in your area, and share personalized tips for optimal pest control, but your input matters here too. As you get more familiar with your new home, you can share your unique experiences with your PMP to optimize service calls and overall control. </li> </ol> <p>Depending on the insects that are found in and around your new home, a pest management professional can provide you with a plan to eradicate these pests and prevent future infestations. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6041C8D989524C279785459778922ABA&amp;_z=z">Check out our helpful resources to get started and to find an exterminator near you.</a> </p>
