        <p>Kids are back in school, and that means now is the time to prevent infestations in and around schools. Harmful pests can show up on playgrounds, in classrooms and in cafeterias. Keeping these areas clear of insects like ants, cockroaches and wasps is a vital step in keeping students safe at school.
        </p>
        <p>Zoecon<span style="font-size: 10px;"><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Professional Products has all that schools need to prevent infestations. For every area, Zoecon<span style="font-size: 10px;"><sup>&reg;</sup></span> has you covered.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Keep stinging insects off playgrounds</strong></h3>
        <p>Playgrounds and outdoor areas are perfect places for stinging insects such as wasps, hornets and yellow jackets to set up nests. These insects pose a threat to young kids and are easily provoked. Proactively getting rid of any sign of nests is necessary for the safety of children this school year.
        </p>
        <p><a href="/all-products/zenprox/zenprox-wasp-x2">Zenprox<span style="font-size: 10px;"><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Wasp-X<span style="font-size: 10px;"><sup>&reg;</sup></span>2</a> Spray is what you need to help eliminate the threat of stinging insects at community areas, including parks and school playgrounds. This spray provides immediate knockdown of wasps, hornets and yellow jackets, and can be used inside and outside with a foaming spray that reaches up to 20 feet.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Eliminate infestations in cafeterias</strong></h3>
        <p>In busy cafeterias, making sure all areas are clear of infestations helps keep kids healthy during the day. Cockroaches, fruit flies and drain flies often find their way into kitchens and can contaminate food.</p>
        <p><a href="/all-products/gentrol/gentrol-complete-ec3">Gentrol<span style="font-size: 10px;"><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Complete EC3</a> provides broad-spectrum relief from listed kitchen insects and breaks their life cycles to prevent new infestations. This combination of an insecticide and insect growth regulator (IGR) takes down a handful of insect threats. This multi-rate formulation tackles all levels of kitchen infestations.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Prevent ants from invading classrooms</strong></h3>
        <p>Ants may be small insects, but when an infestation occurs, they quickly become a nuisance. In places with food, sugary drinks and other attractants to ants, it is important to keep an eye out for infestations. If ants start to appear, Central Life Sciences has the solution. </p>
        <p><a href="/all-products/premise/antack-liquid-ant-bait">Antack&trade; Liquid Ant bait</a> works to destroy ant colonies by introducing an active ingredient that excites an ant&rsquo;s nervous system. This wipes out individual ants and the queen, preventing future generations from emerging. Antack&trade; Liquid Ant bait can be used indoors and outdoors, and it kills listed ants within 48 hours. </p>
