        <p>Summertime is here and so are stinging insects. Wasps, hornets and yellow jackets pose a greater threat than simply ruining outdoor fun. Their painful stings and tendency to swarm when disturbed cause harm to anyone, especially children and those with allergies. Threat levels vary from species to species, but control is necessary anytime a hive or nest is near outdoor recreational or living areas. Make sure your customers know that getting ahead of stinging insects is vital for their homes and businesses this summer.</p>
        <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #008d5a;">Identifying The Insects</span></strong></h2>
        <p>Knowing what stinging insect you&rsquo;re dealing with also determines how to handle them. Many bees, for example, are vital to the environment because they are pollinators. Some species of bees can be relocated, but for severe infestations, some form of professional control is best. </p>
        <p>Hornets and wasps are a different story. Wasps and hornets are generally protective of their nests and it takes little to provoke them. When they feel threatened, they can start to swarm which poses a risk to home and business owners. Identifying and addressing wasp and hornet nests is imperative for the safety of homes, businesses, and recreational areas, especially during the summertime. Wasps are generally slimmer than bees with yellow and brown or black coloration. Common species include mud dauber and paper wasps. Hornets vary in color and size. Bald-faced hornets have white markings on their faces with black and white bodies. European hornets are yellow and black with large black eyes. </p>
        <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #008d5a;">Common Nesting Spots</span></strong></h2>
        <p>Checking for nests is a vital step in keeping stinging insects away from your property and community properties. Common nesting spots include the underside of decks and porches, awnings, play sets, and structural overhangs. Wasps and hornets also build their nests in shrubbery and trees. Be sure to check the entire property for potential nests. </p>
