        <p><strong>COVID-19 Pest Management Challenges &amp; Sensitive Accounts</strong> </p>
        <p>Due to COVID-19, schools, daycares, and libraries closed abruptly earlier this year, giving facility teams little to no time to prepare these buildings for extended vacancy. With the changes in human behavior, insects&rsquo; usual food sources, including cafeterias, food prep areas, kitchens, dumpsters, and garbage cans were empty, forcing insects to become more resourceful in order to survive. Now more than ever, it is crucial that PMPs and facility management teams address potential pest control problems in order to prevent serious infestations by: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly identifying common pests found in schools, daycares, and libraries     </li>
            <li>Implementing an integrated pest management (IPM) program     </li>
            <li>Choosing green pest control products for long-term residual control</li>
        </ul>
        Learn about the best treatment practices in sensitive accounts along with the insects you can control with green pest solutions below.

        <p><strong>Bed Bugs Still Threaten Hotels in the Time of COVID-19</strong> </p>
        <p>Whether closed or open, hotels are upping housekeeping protocols to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, hotel management must be careful not to lose sight of another risk that also remains&mdash; bed bugs. As standards for cleanliness increase, a single bed bug sighting could be disastrous to a hotel&rsquo;s reputation, and the presence of these insects brings the threat of costly litigation as well. The Zo&euml;con team recently created a comprehensive COVID-19 hotel protocol guide to help PMPs eliminate bed bugs, consisting of: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Treating with a mix of products, like residuals and aerosols     </li>
            <li>Performing a 48-hour follow-up inspection     </li>
            <li>Educating staff on signs to look out for in order to reduce the need for multiple visits during COVID-19     </li>
        </ul>
        For more details, see the complete list of tips and product recommendations below.
