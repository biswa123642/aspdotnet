The Zoёcon team is here to help prepare your team for the uptick in ticks with a combination of best practices and products that will help keep your customers safe against disease-spreading arachnids all summer long. </p> <h2>Backyard protocol </h2> <p>The Professional Pest Management Alliance (PPMA) encourages all pest control companies to help educate customers on the dangers associated with ticks, and how they can help prevent ticks on their property. Since most species of ticks thrive in shady areas and tree trunks, backyard maintenance and sanitation plays a crucial part in controlling ticks. Before treatment, have your technicians share these simple maintenance practices with your clients to help reduce tick populations in their yard: </p> <ul>     <li>Remove leaf litter</li>     <li>Clear tall grasses and brush around homes and at the edge of lawns</li>     <li>Place a 3-foot wide barrier of wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to restrict tick migration into recreational areas</li>     <li>Mow the lawn frequently </li>     <li>Keep playground equipment, decks, and patios away from yard edges and trees</li> </ul> <h2>Go Green for Control </h2> <p>While sanitation goes a long way, using a combination of products will also help keep your customer&rsquo;s property a tick-free zone. The best products for tick treatments are sensitive on the environment and to household pets. Botanical pest control products, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> IC-3 Insecticide Concentrate</a>, can be applied with confidence around sensitive areas to deliver broad-spectrum tick control. </p> <h2>Control With Confidence </h2> <p>From the different species of ticks to their most common infestation sites, our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1823CC48AF1141E4A20E72C4A69AF98F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Tick Fact Sheet</a> serves as another resource to help your team determine the right tick control strategies and products for your customers.
