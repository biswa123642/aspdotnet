        <strong>Control These 4 Insects with Green Products
        </strong><span style="background-color: inherit;"></span><strong>
        </strong>
        <p> Botanical insecticides have been used for centuries to control and repel a number of different insects. And while green pest control products continue to be used primarily in residential accounts, PMPs also rely on them for a variety of commercial and sensitive accounts including restaurants, office buildings, warehouses, schools, daycares, nursing facilities, and more. Read on to learn about four insects that you can control using eco-friendly pest control products. </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ants:</strong> With ant infestations occurring both inside and out, customers prefer a green insecticide that&rsquo;s designed for both indoor and outdoor pest control. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3379C99C23124BE38E45E1B3C4C9865F&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> All Purpose Insect Concentrate</a> will keep your customers covered, providing natural ant control from the kitchen to the backyard and everywhere in between.     </li>
            <li><strong>Cockroaches:</strong> Indoor pests like German and American cockroaches are difficult to treat in households and restaurants throughout the country. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=32466C5257D04E49B79826BD11F09CA6&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> Contact Spray</a> provides natural roach control with broad application opportunities, including in sensitive accounts and uses around children and pets. This easy-to-use solution gives you the flexibility to apply to various surfaces including around refrigerators, cabinets, baseboards, appliances, and more.     </li>
            <li><strong>Mosquitoes:</strong> According to PCT Research, the percentage of survey respondents choosing mosquitoes as a &ldquo;top three&rdquo; pest for green products has more than doubled from 2016 to 2020 (from 15 percent to 34 percent). Green insecticides like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> IC-3 Insecticide Concentrate</a> can be used as a natural mosquito repellent, providing fast knockdown and lasting residual control. A FIFRA 25(b) exempt pesticide, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> IC-3 Insecticide Concentrate</a> is ideal for perimeter treatments, and can also be applied for broadcast, spot or fogging applications. Have you seen our new helpful mosquito poster yet? <a href="-/media/3A982B85946149DC9CFCC5FE47B51B72.ashx">Check it out here.</a>     </li>
            <li><strong>Spiders:</strong> Spiders are one of the two pests (along with mosquitoes) to move up in the ranks of the &ldquo;Insects Most Commonly Controlled&rdquo; list in the 2020 State of the Naturals Market study conducted by PCT Magazine. Because these insects can be found around sensitive areas where people gather like patio furniture and play areas, pest management professionals should turn to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> IC-3</a> for a natural spider killer.</li>

        <p><strong>It&rsquo;s Tick Time! </strong></p>
        <p> Pest management companies operating in the Midwest are more likely to see the demand for tick-control services due to the prevalence of Lyme disease-carrying ticks in the region. Clients should be educated on how they can help prevent and lower the risk of disease-spreading ticks on their property. Share these simple maintenance practices with your clients to help reduce tick populations in their yard: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove leaf litter     </li>
            <li>Clear tall grasses and brush around homes and at the edge of lawns     </li>
            <li>Place a 3-foot wide barrier of wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to restrict tick migration into recreational areas     </li>
            <li>Mow the lawn frequently     </li>
            <li>Keep playground equipment, decks, and patios away from yard edges and trees     </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While maintenance goes a long way, using a combination of products will also help keep your customer&rsquo;s property a tick-free zone. The best products for tick treatments are sensitive on the environment and to household pets. Botanical products, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria<sup>&reg;</sup> IC-3 Insecticide Concentrate</a>, can be applied with confidence around sensitive areas to deliver broad-spectrum tick control. See our other tips and product recommendations to keep customers safe from these disease-spreading arachnids below. </p>

        <p><strong>The Key to Flea-Free Homes </strong></p>
        <p> Due to people and pets spending more time outdoors in parks and backyards, as well as historically high pet adoption levels, many PMPs are seeing an increase in flea activity. For the most efficient flea treatment, remind homeowners to follow these helpful steps both before and after product application: </p>
        <p><strong>Before the Treatment</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vacuum all rugs, carpets, and furniture &ndash; especially between and under cushions. Then, tightly seal and dispose of the vacuum bag outside.     </li>
            <li>Clear and clean all floors, even closets. Mop all tile and vinyl floors. Sweep all concrete floors.     </li>
            <li>Remove all decorative items such as pillows and blankets. Be sure to check for items under beds and furniture.     </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>After the Treatment</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wait for the specific instructions from your PMP to find out when it is safe to return home.</li>
            <li>Wait to resume normal vacuuming 24 hours after a home has been treated to give the insecticide time to work.</li>
        </ul>
