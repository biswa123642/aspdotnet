        <h2> Northeast | Loren Cunnington</h2> <p><strong>STOP SPIDERS FROM MOVING IN </strong></p> <p>Wanting to make their way inside where it&rsquo;s warm, spiders are looking to move in with home owners this season in the Northeast region. </p> <p>The first step in getting rid of these unwanted guests is to properly secure and treat the home&rsquo;s perimeter. Make sure to patch and seal any potential entry points like cracks around windows and doors. After all entries have been eliminated, treat the home&rsquo;s perimeter including hard-to-reach spots like gutters and eaves where spiders like to call home with an insecticide like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BA7BEA48991340CE85F77EF5D75CB756&amp;_z=z">Lambda 9.7 CS</a> or a greener alternative such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B44D820BBA27424887DDD4C5932F03C0&amp;_z=z">Essentria&reg; IC-3</a>.</p> <p>Indoors, encourage home owners to thoroughly vacuum each room of their home to suck up any spider eggs before treatment.

        <h2>Central Mountain | Blaine Oakeson </h2> <p><strong>TIPS FOR A TICK-PROOF YARD </strong></p> <p> As we look beyond the snow and mentally prepare for spring, part of that prep work should include ticks. Tickborne diseases in the U.S. have grown nearly every year since 2004, reaching an all-time high in 2017. The final 2018 numbers are projected to be even higher as this insect and the diseases it spreads continue to grow in numbers. Due to these growing concerns, the CDC actively monitors the spread and offers <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/" target="_blank">prevention tips</a>.</p> <p> In our region, tick season can begin as early as March. To get ahead of tick populations this spring, there are some tips you can offer customers to help tick-proof the backyard. First, make sure tall grasses and brush are cleared and the lawn is regularly mowed. Playground equipment, decks and patios should be placed away from the edges of the yard and trees, and in a sunny location if possible. Finally, surrounding play equipment or seating areas with a 3-foot barrier of wood chips or gravel can help prevent ticks from reaching these areas.</p> <p> For the control of ticks indoors, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=953D362190E349FEBE2E761ABF313EAD&amp;_z=z">Precor&reg; 2625 Premise Spray</a> offers a combination IGR and adulticide product in a convenient aerosol. The product can be applied as a broadcast spray or crack-and-crevice treatment for hard-to-reach areas. Mentally preparing now can pay dividends.</p> <blockquote> <h3>PRECOR&reg; </h3> <p>EASE AND EFFICIENCY WITH PRECOR&reg; PRODUCTS </p> <p>Precor&reg; products leave you feeling reassured you got the job done against fleas and ticks indoors, surrounding you and your customers with confidence.</p> <p><a href="-/media/463D854B3C074E9790083BCF2E017089.ashx" target="_blank">Download the Precor&reg; Family Brochure</a> </p> </blockquote><hr />
