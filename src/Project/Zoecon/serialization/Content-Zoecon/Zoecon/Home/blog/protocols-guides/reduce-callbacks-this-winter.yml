        <h2 style=`"z-index: 1;`"></h2><image src="~/media/AEDCE9A04F36467E891FD67B28279E08.ashx" /><p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, restaurants in some regions are being forced to close their doors again for the winter season. As a result, the demand for winter pest control in this normally reliable market could dip significantly. With this loss, however, comes an opportunity for pest management professionals to shift their focus towards residential pest control. </p> <p>With customers spending so much time in their homes, from working remotely to having a full house with virtual schooling on the rise, the need to keep their homes pest free is a bigger priority than ever before. The biggest challenge with residential pest control this year is customer wariness about coming into direct contact with pest management professionals due to the ongoing pandemic. When you pair this with their fear of having callbacks and repeat visits, it&rsquo;s vital for PMPs to educate customers on insect growth regulators (IGRs) for sustained insect control throughout the winter. At Zo&euml;con, we offer solutions that provide the long-lasting control your customers desire, with our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E43D88ECC01848CF9D08A7A35ED45AD2&amp;_z=z">Gentrol<sup>&reg;</sup> IGRs</a> that offer up to 120 days of control and our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7B8E3C76E0EF498495B8D16C5092223D&amp;_z=z">Precor<sup>&reg;</sup> family</a> of products that deliver 7 months protection from flea emergence. <strong>Learn how you can adjust in these unprecedented times and educate your customers on residential pest control and the importance of IGRs.</strong> </p> <p><strong>Kitchen and Bathroom Pests:</strong> </p> <p>Share these tips with your customers to help ensure a pest-free kitchen and bathroom this winter. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Ants:</strong> Examine edges of counters, seams and baseboards.

They can be used with insecticides for complete control and elimination of costly callbacks while helping reduce face-to-face interactions between clients and PMPs during these unprecedented times. </p> <p><em>Article originally appeared in GCPMA</em></p>
