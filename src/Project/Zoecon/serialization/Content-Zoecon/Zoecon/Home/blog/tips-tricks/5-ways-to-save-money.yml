        <p>Maximizing profitability is one of the main responsibilities that come along with owning a business. From maintaining equipment to avoiding credit card late-payment fees, there are a number of strategies that can help protect your company&rsquo;s bottom line. Read on to learn five money-managing tactics that can help save your pest control company money now and later on down the road.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use the Right Product</strong>  <br />   This might seem like a no-brainer but it is more challenging than you may think. Using the wrong product or active ingredient can result in a callback and an unhappy customer. Make sure you and your team do the proper research and training when buying and using products to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the job done right, the first time. </li>
            <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Go the Extra Mile.  </strong>  <br />   Miles on the road can really add up quickly. Keep an eye on time spent driving from one client to the next by working with your crew to create a schedule. Digital planning tools accessible from your team&rsquo;s smartphones are readily available and will aid in planning out who is going to be in what area at what time, alleviating any unnecessary crossover and overtime.  </li>
            <li><strong>Mark Your Calendar</strong> <br />    Missing one credit card or rental payment can lead to a domino effect when it comes to paying bills and managing funds. Avoid late fees and interest penalties by scheduling out payments, using an auto-pay feature offered by most companies, and utilizing the various calendar features on your computer to remind yourself what bills are coming up in the future.   </li>
            <li><strong>Clean Machines Mean More Green </strong>  <br />   Practice and preach good equipment maintenance to help your company get the most out of its investments. Establish standard operating procedures (SOP&rsquo;s) for properly cleaning and maintaining sprayers, pumps, spreaders, foggers, and other equipment regularly. This ounce of prevention can help you save money on costly repairs and avoid appointment delays. </li>
            <li><strong>Take Advantage of Rebates</strong>  <br />   Put some extra cash in your pockets by participating in the Zo&euml;con 2020 Rebate Program. From monthly rebate opportunities to online submission forms, we&rsquo;ve made it easy for you to maximize your company&rsquo;s productivity and profitability.
