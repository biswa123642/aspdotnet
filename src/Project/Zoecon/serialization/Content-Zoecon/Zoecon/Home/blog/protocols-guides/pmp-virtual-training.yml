With social distancing, reduced staffs, and less in-person opportunities for training, it&rsquo;s important for managers and owners like you to encourage your team to continue their training and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends. With proper training tools and product protocol, callbacks can be limited. Less callbacks mean reduced multiple visits, all contributing to a proactive plan in preventing your clients and staff from being exposed to COVID-19. </p> <p>At Zo&euml;con, it is our company&rsquo;s philosophy that pest management professionals are the drivers of our business and that investing in their knowledge benefits everyone involved.
