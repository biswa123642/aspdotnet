        </div>
        <p>Spring is here for most parts of the country, and we are all ready to leave the cold weather of winter behind. Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, new pesticide product reviews and revisions were put on hold. This will delay some of our planned product launches from Zo&euml;con, but we are excited to share more information about these new launches in the months to come. In the meantime, as you read through this newsletter you will see a common thread about how to reduce callbacks this season.</p>
        <p>Spring also means preparing your customers for the return of many different pests based on your region. As temperatures start to warm up, tick season is high on many radars and the spread continues to new regions. We recommend that PMPs keep a close eye on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/" target="_blank">tick disease surveillance data</a>  to monitor tick activity across the country. And as always, you can consult with your local Zo&euml;con rep about the best solutions to control these and other insects in your area and reduce callbacks.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to introduce <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zoecon.com/-/media/Files/CentralLifeSciences-NA/US/News/Zoecon%20Hires%20Bennett%20Deutsch%20Mobley.pdf" target="_blank">Walker Mobley as the newest member of our sales team</a>. Walker will cover Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and we are excited to have him on board.</p>

        <h2> Northeast | Loren Cunnington</h2>
        <p><strong>TICK TREATMENT TIPS </strong></p>
        <p>Ticks are a common problem pest in the Northeast region, making prevention a vital part of tick control. As temperatures slowly begin to warm, keep these tips in mind for a successful treatment and satisfied clients.</p>
        <p>Ticks wait in tall grasses for their next host to pass by, which is why a major part of preventing ticks involves yard management. To keep tick populations out of their yard and to create a &ldquo;tick-free zone&rdquo;, clients need to keep landscaping trimmed and yard edges neat, especially when properties end near wooded areas.</p>
        <p>A quick tick tip: Prevent tick hosts, such as deer and mice, by relocating woodpiles away from the home, removing garden waste and securing trash containers. This lowers the chance of ticks dropping from hosts within the tick-free zone.</p>
        <p>Zo&euml;con offers effective options that include traditional chemistries such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BA7BEA48991340CE85F77EF5D75CB756&amp;_z=z">Lambda 9.7 CS</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=10E9CC0A9095463E835EC531AD2779B8&amp;_z=z">ExciteR&trade;</a>.

        <p><strong>FLORIDA PMP TRUSTS ZENPROX&reg; XTEND AEROSOL TO TREAT VA HOSPITAL </strong></p>
        <p>Bed bugs are found in many <a href="-/media/A0818B4932AF4BF9856CB3F6D04B2DF3.ashx">places outside of bedrooms</a>, including on public transportation and in schools. When Georgia McCallister of PestMaster Services in Florida treats for bed bugs in a local veterans hospital, she trusts Zenprox&reg; Xtend Aerosolto effectively control the pest.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Homeless veterans who come into the hospital may bring bed bugs in, then the pests spread quickly throughout the hospital,&rdquo; said McCallister. &ldquo;Using Zenprox&reg; Xtend Aerosol, I treat under the end tables, turn the furniture upside-down and treat everything floor to ceiling per label, and I have never had to retreat a room.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Zenprox&reg; Xtend Aerosol combines an insect growth regulator (IGR) with an insecticide inside a 360-degree valve aerosol to deliver efficient pest treatments and reduce callbacks.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have been a Zo&euml;con fan since the early 90s,&rdquo; said McCallister. &ldquo;When veterans hospitals have even one bed bug, that&rsquo;s one bug too many. Zenprox&reg; not only dispenses well, it kills immediately and the residual is great.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><strong>KITCHEN CONTROL STARTS WITH GENTROL&reg; PRODUCTS </strong></p>
        <p>Kitchen infestations present a number of challenges for pest management professionals and their customers. German cockroaches, drain flies, fruit flies, stored product pests, and other kitchen pests are difficult to control, and they tend to hide in the many nooks and crannies. To control kitchen pests, we recommend using products from our Gentrol&reg; family. Why Gentrol&reg;? Because not all insect growth regulators provide the confidence and reduced callbacks as our proprietary active ingredient, s-hydroprene.</p>
        <p>For convenience, try our one-step product, Gentrol&reg; Complete Aerosol which features dual active ingredients to break the pest life cycle, particularly those common to food-handling environments. It&rsquo;s approved for use in sensitive areas, including direct applications to sink drains.</p>
        <p>For tank-sprayer applications, our translocating active ingredient gets into the hard-to-reach areas. Gentrol&reg; IGR Concentrate can be applied as a fogging agent, general surface spray or tank mixed. Gentrol&reg; IGR Concentrate controls pests for four months and can be used in sensitive application sites including kitchens, schools, hospitals and nursing homes. </p>

        <p><strong>TREATMENT TIPS FOR FLEA CONTROL </strong></p>
        <p>As our region prepares for spring, flea populations that were dormant during the winter will begin to build. With pre-adult fleas making up approximately 95% of a typical infestation, treatments need to be thorough and PMPs need to know where to look.</p>
        <p>Client preparation should include vacuuming all rugs, carpet and furniture, cleaning and clearing all floors, removing all decorative items and washing all linen. Once the client is prepared, check for fleas in these four crucial areas: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Floors, carpets, hardwood and tile - Look for gaps, near the feet of furniture and in thresholds.</li>
            <li>Drapes and wall hangings - Inspect for fleas on crown molding, valances and behind photo frames.</li>
            <li>Furniture - Move or disassemble furniture to find fleas.</li>
            <li>Pets and bedding - Check all areas that pets frequent such as a certain side of the couch or beds and headboards.     </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When applied early in the season, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7B8E3C76E0EF498495B8D16C5092223D&amp;_z=z">Precor&reg; products</a> can help stop flea infestations before they start. Offered in a range of formulations, Precor&reg; products feature up to seven months of control against future flea infestations, allowing you to do more with less and reduce callbacks.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <h3>Precor&reg; Family Brochure </h3>
        <p>GET TO THE ROOT OF FLEA INFESTATIONS</p>
        <p>Rid homes of fleas you can see and those you can&rsquo;t using the Precor&reg; family of products. Formulated with (S)-methoprene, Precor&reg; products stop the development of immature fleas into adults, thus breaking the life cycle.</p>
