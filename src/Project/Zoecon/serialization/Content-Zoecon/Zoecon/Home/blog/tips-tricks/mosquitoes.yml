To help set them at ease and get them involved, teach clients about the mosquito breeding areas around their home and how to remove them. Educating as well as treating with effective products will go a long way in the fight against mosquitoes. </p> <p>Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, so dispose of anything that could collect water such as old tires, buckets and planters. Items that catch water in the yard should be emptied once a week, including birdbaths. </p> <p>Remind clients to keep their yard free of debris, as a single plastic bag could blow onto their property into shrubs, collect water and become a breeding source. </p> <p><em>Article originally appeared in PMP Magazine</em> </p>
