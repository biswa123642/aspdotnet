        </h1>
        <h2>Information Collected</h2>
        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Any time you visit sulfodene.com, we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site and where you go on our Web Site.

        <p><strong>Information Voluntarily Provided</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Any information you provide to us (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.) when you request information, or use any of the other interactive portions of our Web sites, is securely maintained on our Web server and internal systems. This information may be used to provide you with information you've requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices. You may opt out of receiving future communications at any time (see Opt-Out Procedures below).</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Information Collected from Other Sources</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We may in the future receive information about you from other sources. We will maintain any such information in accordance with the standards set forth in this privacy policy.

        <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Information about our Web Site visitors is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We may share your information only as described below and with subsidiaries that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Business Partners</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times to provide expanded services to our Web Site visitors.

        <p><strong>Agents</strong>

You should not receive unsolicited e-mail messages from agents working on our behalf.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, Web Site visitor information will most likely be one of the transferred assets. However, such transferred information will remain subject to the terms of any pre-existing Privacy Policy of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Compliance with Law/Safety</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We may disclose specific personal information based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company, along with its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliated and/or related companies.
        </p>
        <p><strong>With Your Consent</strong>
        </p>
