        <h2>HOW TO FIX MOUND DAMAGE</h2>
        After effective treatment, use the mound's soil to fill any visible openings. Then rake the remainder into a thin layer on the surrounding turf. If grass under the mound is still green and healthy, it should bounce back. If grass is yellow, brown or missing, simply repair the bare spots in your lawn. An all-in-one combination grass seed, mulch and fertilizer product will have your lawn green again fast.
        Until you're certain you've identified your mounding pest properly, err on the side of caution. Fire ants swarm, bite and sting when their mounds are disturbed, so take care when inspecting and treating them.
