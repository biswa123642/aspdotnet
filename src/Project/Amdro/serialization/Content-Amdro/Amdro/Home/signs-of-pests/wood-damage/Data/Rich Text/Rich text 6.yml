        <h2>HOW TO FIX WOOD DAMAGE</h2>
        By the time you discover wood-damaging pests, the harm they've done may be extensive. With carpenter bees, you're more likely to catch damage early on. But carpenter ants and termites often go unnoticed until they've established large, destructive colonies.
        While wood fillers take care of brand-new entry holes, especially for carpenter bees, long-standing infestations of any wood-damaging pest can mean major repairs or reconstruction. Professional structural inspections can help you assess pest damage and protect your home's integrity and value.
