        <h2>HOW TO FIX SLIME TRAILS</h2>
        Snail and slug slime changes in viscosity and adhesion according to pressure from the pest's contracting foot. Add water to wet slime and you may have a bigger mess. Instead, wipe the slime with a disposable cloth or paper towel first. Then rinse the wiped area clean. For dried slime, use water and a broom or brush. Slugs and snails can carry pathogens, so always wear gloves and avoid direct contact with snails, slugs or their slime.
