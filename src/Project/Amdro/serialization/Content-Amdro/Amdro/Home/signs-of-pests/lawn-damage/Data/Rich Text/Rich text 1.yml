        <h1>Grass or Lawn Damage</h1>
        Pests that damage grass or lawns work in several ways. Some injure grass blades and stems directly by feeding on lawns above ground. Others do their dirty work below the soil line, often attracting more lawn-damaging pests in the process. Learning to recognize signs of pest-related grass or lawn damage can help you keep your lawn lush and attractive.
