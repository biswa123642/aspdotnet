        <h2>HOW TO FIX LEAF DAMAGE</h2>
        When leaves suffer damage, the holes don't repair themselves. Leaf damage remains until the plant drops its leaves or dies. If pests damage a small number of leaves, simply prune the damaged leaves away. If the entire plant sustains heavy damage, large-scale leaf removal may shock the plant further. For annuals, replace the plant. For large plants, it's best to leave the damage as is and let nature take its course.
