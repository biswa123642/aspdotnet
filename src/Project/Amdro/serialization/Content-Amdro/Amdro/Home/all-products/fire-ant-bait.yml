      Hint: AdditionalInfo
      Value: "<h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Is it safe for me to use this product near my pets? </strong><br /> The active ingredient in Amdro Fire Ant Bait is hydramethylnon which has very low toxicity to people, animals and birds. When used according to the label we wouldn't expect any problems to your pets. </p> <p><strong>Is it safe to use around lakes and ponds? <br /> </strong>This product is toxic to fish, therefore we recommend using Amdro Fire Ant Bait with caution when applying near ponds or lakes. </p> <p><strong>Will my sprinklers affect the treatment and will the product dissolve by getting wet? </strong><br /> Amdro Fire Ant Bait is made from corn grit. When it gets wet, the bait becomes soggy and is no longer appealing to the fire ants. The longer you can keep the area dry, the better the chances you have of the bait being picked up and carried back to the colony. We recommend applying the product when rain is not expected within 24 hours. </p> <p><strong>Is this product safe to be used in areas near grazing cattles or in  pastures? </strong><br /> This product should not be used in areas where animals graze or in pastures. </p> <p><strong>Can it be used in a garden or near a well? </strong><br /> Amdro Fire Ant Bait granules is approved for use in ornamental and flower gardens but not for vegetable gardens. We recommend using caution when applying near a well as it should not be directly applied into the well. </p>"
