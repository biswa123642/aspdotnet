        <h2>MILLIPEDE IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Loosely translated from Latin, the word "millipede" means "thousand feet." While these creatures don't have that many legs, they do have quite a few. Millipedes are non-insect arthropods. Numerous hard-shelled segments make up their worm-like bodies. As millipedes mature, they add body segments. Common millipedes reach 1/2 to 2 inches long, but some species grow three times that length or more.</p>
        <p> Millipedes and centipedes look similar, but these distant relatives are easy to tell apart. Each segment of a millipede body has two pairs of short legs. Each centipede body segment has one pair of long legs. When disturbed, slow-moving millipedes curl into a tight spiral. Disturb a centipede, and it runs for cover.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF MILLIPEDES</h2>
        <p> Under normal conditions, millipedes feed on decaying leaves and other decomposing garden debris. Living plants aren't typically on the menu unless millipede numbers increase and decaying food gets scarce. Then young, tender seedlings take the brunt of the damage.</p>
        <p> Because millipedes feed at night, you'll rarely catch them in the act. Signs of nighttime feeding include irregular chewing marks on plant stems and on new plant growth. If you suspect millipedes, inspect areas with moist or decaying material, including garden mulches and fallen leaves, around injured plants.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL MILLIPEDES</h2>
        <p>Millipedes spend most of their time hiding in soil or damp plant debris, but they often enter homes after heavy rains or when fall temperatures start to drop. Once inside they don't live long, but they're unwelcome just the same.</p>
        <p> Effective millipede control reaches these pests in their hiding places and stops them before they come indoors. Amdro&reg; brand products can help you keep millipedes outdoors where they belong:</p>
