        <h2>DEER TICK IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Female deer ticks have orange-red bodies with a dark, brown-black scale right behind their head. Male deer ticks are completely dark brown. The adult female measures roughly 1/8 inch long &mdash; about the size of an apple seed &mdash; with the male being slightly smaller. After feeding, female deer ticks engorged with blood can balloon up to 1/2 inch in length. Deer tick nymphs grow less than 1/16 inch long. Larvae are smaller still.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF DEER TICKS</h2>
        <p>Deer ticks congregate in tall grass and brushy areas where the deer and other wildlife that often transport them hang out. To check your property for deer ticks, take a white towel and drag it slowly through the suspected area. The ticks will attach to the passing cloth, like they would a pant leg. Though small, deer ticks are easily seen against the white backdrop.</p>
        <p>Bites from ticks infected with Lyme-causing bacterium cause a distinctive skin rash around the bite site. The rash looks like a target with a bull's eye center. Doctors can diagnose Lyme disease most easily when the rash is present. If you suspect a Lyme-transmitting tick has bitten you, don't delay medical attention.</p>
