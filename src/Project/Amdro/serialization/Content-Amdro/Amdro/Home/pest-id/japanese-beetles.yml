        <h2>JAPANESE BEETLE IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>As their name suggests, Japanese beetles originated in Asia. Without natural predators in the United States, they're expanding their range each year. Adult Japanese beetles grow about 1/2 inch long. Their metallic green bodies bear metallic bronze wing covers. A row of distinctive tiny white hair tufts line their sides and rears.</p>
        <p> Japanese beetles are especially troublesome because they damage lawns and plants extensively in both their adult and larval state. Their gray-white larvae, known as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3EA35534511341308FA185783A63BE80&amp;_z=z">grubs</a>, grow about 1 inch long and curl into a "C" when disturbed.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF JAPANESE BEETLES</h2>
        <p> Japanese beetles typically congregate in sunny, well-irrigated areas. No plant or plant part seems safe. The adults feast on the plant leaves, buds, flowers and fruit of hundreds of plant species. Leaf damage is very recognizable; only the veins remain on the skeletonized leaves.</p>
        <p> Damage from Japanese beetle larvae shows up as large patches of wilting, brown lawn grass in late summer and early fall. The larvae sever roots as they feed. The spongy turf they leave behind feels like a loose rug beneath your feet.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL JAPANESE BEETLES</h2>
        <p>If you have had Japanese beetle infestations in previous years, be proactive. Don't wait to treat until you see them again. Effective control of these voracious pests requires killing the beetles you see and the grubs you don't see yet. Amdro&reg; brand products allow you to treat both life stages effectively, and protect your lawn and landscape from new Japanese beetles that fly in:</p>

        <h2>JAPANESE BEETLE CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Immature Japanese beetles spend winter as underground grubs. They emerge as adult beetles in late spring to midsummer to feed and lay eggs. Early treatments hit grubs and adults to prevent new generations of grub and beetle destruction.</p>
