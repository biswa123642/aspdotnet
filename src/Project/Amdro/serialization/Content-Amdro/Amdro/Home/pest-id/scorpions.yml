        <h2>SCORPION IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Most scorpions found in the United States live in the warm, dry southwest and western regions of the country. More closely related to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=13EBD8343E4D41D0897E135A74F2D83C&amp;_z=z">spiders</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=49442B08DA9C439BBDBD5AB134FD79FB&amp;_z=z">ticks</a>&nbsp;than insects, these stinging pests look a lot like crabs. Depending on the species, scorpions vary in color from pale yellow-brown to nearly black. Most common types grow 2 to 3 inches long, but some species measure 8 inches or more.</p>
        <p> Scorpions have eight legs and two large front pinchers that they use to hold their prey as they sting it. Their long, segmented tails end with a venom-filled stinger. Some scorpions curve their tails high over their backs, but others curve theirs to the side. While most scorpion stings aren't life-threatening for humans, reactions can be painful and severe.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF SCORPIONS</h2>
        <p> Scorpions hide under rocks during the day and come out at night to eat creatures from insects to lizards, and even mice. Scorpions don't damage plants, but they do unsettle people when they sneak into homes and surprise them.</p>
        <p> To check your property for signs of scorpions, look for the pests &mdash; carefully &mdash; at night. Patrol your home's perimeter with an ultra-violet "blacklight" flashlight. Because of a substance in their bodies, scorpions appear to glow under UV light. Be sure to look up as you patrol; some scorpions are very good climbers.</p>
