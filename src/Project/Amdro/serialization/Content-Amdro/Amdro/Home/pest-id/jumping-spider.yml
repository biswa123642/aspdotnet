        <h2>JUMPING SPIDER IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Jumping spiders comprise the world's largest family of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=13EBD8343E4D41D0897E135A74F2D83C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">spiders</a>. Hundreds of varied species inhabit North America. Adult jumping spiders typically average 1/5 to 1/2 inch in length. Some species are much smaller, but others measure an inch or more. Colors range from black, gray or brown to metallics and snowy white. Many have vibrant markings. Newly hatched spiderlings look like miniature versions of adults.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences, jumping spiders are easy to recognize. Their extraordinary jumping ability usually gives them away, but their eyes confirm their identity. Like most spiders &mdash; but not all &mdash; jumping spiders have eight eyes. Four of those eyes line up across their flat faces, with the center pair typically quite large. Not surprisingly, jumping spiders have excellent sight.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF JUMPING SPIDERS</h2>
        <p>Jumping spiders don't build telltale webs. Seeing a spider in action is usually the first sign that they're around. These spiders capture their prey by jumping while attached to a single silken thread.</p>
        <p>You may find jumping spiders where flies, moths, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4CCA1393821345F29DD91916C3A2FA96&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">crickets</a>&nbsp;or other potential spider meals congregate &mdash; especially when drawn to lights at night. Small, silky white patches on leaves, stems or walls may indicate nests filled with jumping spider eggs.</p>
