        <h2>GRASSHOPPER IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>No matter where you live in the United States, you've probably encountered a grasshopper. But if you're like many people, you may have called it a cricket [Link to new Crickets pest page] instead. Like crickets, grasshoppers have very large hind legs. But they have short, club-like antennae instead of long, slender antennae like crickets have.</p>
        <p>Many common grasshoppers blend in with the grasses and plants they feed on. They come in shades of gold, brown and grassy greens, but other types range from brilliant colors to black and white. Common grasshoppers grow between 3/4 and 2 inches long &mdash; larger than common crickets &mdash; but many species are much smaller or larger. The type you'll find in your landscape varies depending on where you live.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF GRASSHOPPERS</h2>
        <p> Most grasshopper damage goes unnoticed until weather conditions and food supplies put grasshoppers on the move. Their populations seem to grow in cycles. When this happens, these pests leave trails of destruction as they migrate to find food.</p>
        <p> Rather than chewing small holes, these pests use their large mouthparts to systematically devour large portions of leaves. Though they target young, tender plants first, all types of grasses and plants are at risk.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL GRASSHOPPERS</h2>

        <h2>GRASSHOPPER CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Grasshopper problems get their start in unmaintained areas with long grasses or weeds. Then the pests migrate to cultivated landscapes nearby to feed. To reduce grasshopper visitors, keep your landscape borders short and weed-free.</p>
