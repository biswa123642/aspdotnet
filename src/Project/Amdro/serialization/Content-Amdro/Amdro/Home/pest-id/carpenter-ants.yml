        <h2>CARPENTER ANT IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Common carpenter ants are one of the largest common household ants. Usually dark brown or black, they typically measure up to 3/8 inch in length, but winged reproductive carpenter ants may grow to nearly double that size. Like all <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B938B0C54A2F483B94C88541CA0D5EA5&amp;_z=z">ants</a>, they have a distinct head, thorax (the chest-like middle section) and abdomen. A single, hump-like node at their waist helps distinguish them from other ants, which can have one or two nodes, and node-less insects such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D1D81AA812CB4161BBDFF5C41870C93B&amp;_z=z">wasps</a>.</p>
        <p>Homeowners often confuse carpenter ants with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0AE032274FD147ABA2CFF5B6432D81FF&amp;_z=z">termites</a>, especially during mating times when winged ants appear in swarms. Both these pests damage <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=22B31AB940B949C089FA89EA2517A26A&amp;_z=z">wood</a>, but they look very different. These key features help tell them apart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antennae</strong> &ndash; Ants have jointed antennae; termite antennae are straight.</li>
            <li><strong>Waistlines</strong> &ndash; Ant waists are pinched and defined; termites look like cigars.</li>
            <li><strong>Wing length</strong> &ndash; Ant wing pairs are different lengths; termite wings are equal in length.</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> &ndash; Carpenter ants are usually dark; termites are typically lighter brown.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/E29339C87A144BD7A26A71290C807396.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF CARPENTER ANTS</h2>
        <p> Carpenter ants nest in moist, decaying wood. Unlike termites, they don't eat the wood they excavate. If you see sawdust and insect debris piled below moisture-damaged wood, you have a potential problem. Open the wall and peek inside. Carpenter ant galleries are smooth and debris-free. Termite galleries are rough and lined with excrement.</p>
        <p>Swarms of winged carpenter ants inside your home are a significant sign of a major infestation. This often occurs in spring, when ants mate. While a few winged ants shouldn't worry you, large numbers point to long-term infestations and significant structural damage.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL CARPENTER ANTS</h2>
        <p>One of the country's leading wood-damaging pests, carpenter ants work slower than termites but their damage is severe over time. Effective control requires killing ants you can't see as well as those you can. Amdro&reg; brand offers several options to kill carpenter ants and reclaim your home:</p>
