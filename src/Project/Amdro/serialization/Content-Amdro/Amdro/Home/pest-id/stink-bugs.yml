        <h2>STINK BUG IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Stink bugs get their name from an unpleasant odor they release when threatened. Many species of these foul smelling pests exist. Common stink bugs have shield-shaped bodies that range in color from green to mottled brown. Nearly as wide as they are long, adults typically measure about 5/8 inch in length. Squash bugs, which look very similar, are much narrower.</p>
        <p> Brown marmorated stink bugs are especially troublesome for U.S. homeowners. These invasive Asian natives damage many types of plants, but they also invade homes in fall. Several features distinguish them from other stink bugs: They have light brown bands on their antennae, dark brown bands at the rear of their front wings and alternating cream-white and dark brown bands along their outer abdomen edges.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF STINK BUGS</h2>
        <p> Stink bugs feed on plants with piercing, sucking mouthparts. They damage leaves, flower buds, flowers and fruits. They suck out vital plant juices, leaving brown pits and spots behind. Plants become stunted, fruits and flowers are deformed, leaves wilt and young plants die. Mating stink bugs lay clusters of unique barrel-shaped eggs on lower leaf surfaces.</p>
        <p> On warm fall days, brown marmorated stink bugs converge on homes in staggering numbers. Masses of these pests cover windows, doorways and walls, trying to find openings to get inside. When spring arrives, they come out indoors searching for ways outside. Many people with allergies to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD1FC4161FD84AF6A93C057B0C070860&amp;_z=z">cockroaches</a>&nbsp;have similar reactions to these pests.</p>

        <h2>STINK BUG CONTROL TIPS </h2>
        <p>As they work their way inside in fall, stink bugs release a scent. Different than their defensive stench, this aroma attracts other stink bugs to the site. Act at the earliest sign of these invasive pests before their reinforcements arrive.</p>
