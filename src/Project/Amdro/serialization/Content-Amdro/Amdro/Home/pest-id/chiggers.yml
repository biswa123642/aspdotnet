        <h2>CHIGGER IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Chiggers are the microscopic larvae of small red mites known by various common names, including harvest mites, red bugs and jiggers. As with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=49442B08DA9C439BBDBD5AB134FD79FB&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">ticks</a>, chiggers look similar to their larger adult forms, but the larvae have six legs while the mite's nymph and adult stages have eight. You'll find chiggers in long or overgrown grasses, brushy areas and along lawn edges.</p>
        <p>At just 1/64 inch in the larval stage, chiggers are so tiny you need a microscope to see them. The oval-shaped pests range in color from orange-red to red-brown. Long, sparse hairs cover their legs and bodies. To verify a chigger mite infestation, place a small piece of dark poster board upright in your grass. The red or orange mites will crawl up the board and show themselves against the surface.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF CHIGGERS</h2>
        <p>Only the larval "chigger" stage of these tiny red mites bite and feed on humans. Unlike <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2B1B482AF91F425DB4AA88D946BEC95C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">mosquitoes</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD2D76DF9D3E4FD8B522812259319A88&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">fleas</a>&nbsp;or other pests that go for blood, chiggers feed on skin cells. When they bite, they inject an enzyme that transforms skin cells into chigger food.</p>
        <p>These tiny parasites typically feed for one to three days and then drop off their host. Itching starts with the bite. Small blisters form at the bite site. Chigger bites usually come in multiples, concentrated around ankles, backs of knees, waistlines, fronts of elbows and armpits.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL CHIGGERS</h2>

        <h2>CHIGGER CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>When lawn grasses grow high, chiggers move from the fringes of your property toward the areas where your family plays and entertains. Regular mowing and good lawn maintenance help keep chiggers away.</p>
        <p><em>Always read product labels and follow the instructions carefully.</em></p>
