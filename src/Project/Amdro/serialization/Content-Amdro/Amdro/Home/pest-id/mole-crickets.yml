        <h2>MOLE CRICKET IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>In much of the United States, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3EA35534511341308FA185783A63BE80&amp;_z=z">grubs</a>&nbsp;take the title of "Most Destructive Turf Pests." But in the South, mole crickets have surpassed them. Much of mole cricket damage comes from invasive species accidentally brought to the United States. Two types in particular cause far-ranging harm:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tawny mole crickets</strong> &ndash; Tawny brown in color, these highly destructive pests measure about 1 1/2 to 2     inches long when mature.</li>
            <li><strong>Southern mole crickets</strong> &ndash; Smaller and darker, these turf pests grow 1 to 1 1/2 inches long. Lighter     colored spots top their dark brown heads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mole crickets are instantly recognizable, regardless of the species. Their rear halves look a lot like common <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4CCA1393821345F29DD91916C3A2FA96&amp;_z=z">crickets</a>, but their front halves look more like crustaceans with mole-like claws. Their tapered, segmented antennae are shorter than their bodies. Some species have wings longer than their abdomens; others have wings too short for flight.</p>
        <p><a href="-/media/620F0640C9EA4BC3AFE0712912D8CBF8.ashx"><img alt="" src="-/media/620F0640C9EA4BC3AFE0712912D8CBF8.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></a></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF MOLE CRICKETS</h2>
        <p> Mole crickets damage turf grasses much like moles do. They tunnel just below the surface and scatter small "molehills" along the way. But unlike <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=99332944D5A541E6A24A7BA73A437C9D&amp;_z=z">moles</a>, which don't eat plants, mole crickets sever grass roots, uproot grasses, and feed on roots and shoots as they tunnel.</p>
        <p>Immature mole cricket nymphs, which look like small versions of adults, cause the most damage. As nymphs feed and grow larger through the summer months, their presence becomes clear. Large areas of damaged grasses turn brown and die.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL MOLE CRICKETS</h2>
        <p>Adult mole crickets emerge from the soil in spring to mate and lay eggs. Effective treatment targets these adults and the turf-damaging nymphs that hatch. Nymphs are most vulnerable when they're small and close to the surface. The older and larger they get, the deeper they go. These Amdro&reg; brand products kill existing mole cricket adults and nymphs &mdash; and provide residual treatment for new hatchlings:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>MOLE CRICKET CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Expect nymphs to hatch wherever you see adult mole crickets in spring. Don't wait for evidence &mdash; be proactive and treat those areas before nymph damage starts.</p>
