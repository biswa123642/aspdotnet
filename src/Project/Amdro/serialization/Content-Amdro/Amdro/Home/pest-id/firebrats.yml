        <h2>FIREBRAT IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Firebrats are slender, wingless, nocturnal pests that often make their way indoors during dry summer weather. Closely related to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=83647C994AB04A11AD28C089F8A4A9DA&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">silverfish</a>, they're also known as bristletails, fishmoths, tasseltails or fringetails.</p>
        <p>Firebrats grow up to 1/2 inch long. Instead of metallic silver, these pests have scales of mottled gray and brown. Their soft bodies have two long antennae on their heads, then taper down to three long tail-like appendages. Immature firebrat nymphs look like adults, only smaller.</p>
        <p>Firebrats prefer warmer temperatures than silverfish do. Though drawn to dampness, they tolerate lower humidity and less moisture as well. You'll find them where temperatures reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Areas near ovens, furnaces, boilers, fireplaces and hot water heaters are favorite firebrat hangouts.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF FIREBRATS</h2>
        <p>Firebrats, like silverfish, rarely come out during daytime hours. You may catch them in action when you flip on lights at night or early morning, but most of their dirty work happens in the dark. They scurry across floors toward hiding places when surprised, drawing comparisons to small, quick-moving <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD1FC4161FD84AF6A93C057B0C070860&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">cockroaches</a>.</p>
        <p>Firebrats feed on dry cereals and other foods, but their preferred menu consists of books, wallpaper and other paper products with glue or paste. Like silverfish, firebrats feed by scraping rather than chewing. Damaged books reveal scrape marks, large and irregular holes, excrement and small iridescent scales between pages.</p>
