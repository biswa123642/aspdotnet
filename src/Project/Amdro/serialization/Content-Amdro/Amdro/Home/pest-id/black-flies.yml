        <h2>BLACK FLY IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Black flies include several species of small, dark flies known by various common names, including buffalo gnats, sand flies, punkies and no-see-ums. These biting pests can measure 1/20 to 1/3 inch in length. Viewed in profile, their hump-like thorax looks like the hump on a buffalo's back. Depending on the species and your local weather conditions, these pests can produce several generations per year.</p>
        <p>Black fly larvae mature in water, like mosquito larvae. These pests prefer cool, clean streams and rivers rather than the stagnant, standing water that <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2B1B482AF91F425DB4AA88D946BEC95C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">mosquitoes</a>&nbsp;target. But black flies can develop in backyard water features, too. The legless, wormlike larvae look similar to mosquito larvae, but their bulbous bottoms draw comparisons to bowling pins.<img height="400" alt="black-fly-infestation" width="400" src="-/media/BDFDEDB3B83341B3985908DE070EA850.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF BLACK FLIES</h2>
        <p>The first signs of a black fly problem are usually the painful bites suffered by people, pets, birds, and other wildlife. Some types of nuisance black flies buzz into ears, eyes, noses, and mouths. Other types bite and feed on blood, like extremely aggressive mosquitoes, to get a meal before laying eggs. Adult black flies often appear in swarms.</p>
        <p>Rather than piercing skin, black fly mouthparts slash like tiny blades. The painful, bleeding bites swell, itch and throb for days or even weeks. Humans may get headaches, fever, and nausea when bit. Small animals and children are especially vulnerable to severe reactions.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL BLACK FLIES</h2>
        <p>Black flies are known to travel several miles, so waterfront property isn't required for their visits. Crowded gardens with poor air circulation provide cover as these pests mate, bite, and feed. When known black fly problems exist, treat early in the year to help prevent bites. Treat again at the earliest sign of new black flies.</p>
