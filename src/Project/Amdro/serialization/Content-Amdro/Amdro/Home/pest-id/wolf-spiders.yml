        <h2>WOLF SPIDER IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Wolf spiders get their name because they hunt and ambush their prey &mdash; like wolves &mdash; rather than building webs like other <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=13EBD8343E4D41D0897E135A74F2D83C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">spiders</a>. When mature, these fast-moving spiders measure up to 2 inches long, not counting their legs. Depending on the species, wolf spiders range in color from black and dark gray to brown and tan striped. Though large and hairy, wolf spiders are less than half the size of slow-moving tarantulas</p>
        <p>Female wolf spiders carry their egg sacs with them. When eggs hatch, the spiderlings ride on their mother's body for several weeks as they mature. Homeowners sometimes mistake wolf spiders for venomous brown recluse spiders. But brown recluse spiders typically grow just 1/2 inch long and have a distinctive violin-shaped marking right behind their heads. Wolf spiders can bite, but they rarely do.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF WOLF SPIDERS</h2>
        Without telltale nests or stationary egg sacs, wolf spiders often go undetected in homes. Usually found in basements and crawl spaces, they rarely venture above ground level. They do their hunting at night but occasionally surprise an unfortunate homeowner during the day. Wolf spiders feed on <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4CCA1393821345F29DD91916C3A2FA96&amp;_z=z">crickets</a>&nbsp;and other insect pests, sometimes leaving debris from their prey behind.<br />
