        <h2>SPITTLE BUG IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Two-lined spittle bugs are winged pests that damage lawns and other ornamental plants. Also known as froghoppers, adult two-lined spittle bugs grow about 3/8 inch long. As the first part of their name suggests, they have two bright orange lines across their black wings. When in flight, their bright red abdomens show clearly.</p>
        <p>Adult and immature two-lined spittle bugs feed on grasses and other plants. While adults cause the most damage, the cream-colored nymphs attract more attention. As the nymphs feed, they produce a mass of frothy, spittle-like foam that hangs from grass blades. When populations are high, these pests move into other plants, from hollies to strawberries and asters.<img alt="" height="400" width="400" src="-/media/696E1943178743F4BF5B78CDD7DEA29D.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF SPITTLE BUGS</h2>
        <p>Two-lined spittle bugs trouble lawn grasses such as Zoysia grass, Bermudagrass and Bahiagrass. But Centipede grass lawns are especially vulnerable to these pests. Lawn damage looks very similar to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4FB0ABD03CE8422C811F66FB781C56D0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">chinch bug</a>&nbsp;damage. Early symptoms mimic drought. Affected grasses soon turn yellow and purple-brown. Entire grass plants wilt and die.</p>
        <p>With severe infestations, highly visible spittle masses dot lawns and nearby ornamentals. Close inspection of the spittle yields multiple nymphs inside. Shady lawn areas are most susceptible to spittle bug damage, which peaks in years with heavy spring and summer rains.</p>

        <h2>SPITTLE BUG CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Excess lawn thatch encourages two-lined spittle bug infestations. If your lawn's thatch layer exceeds 1/2 inch, dethatch during its peak growth time. Take extra care with Centipede lawns, which are susceptible to dethatching damage.</p>
        <p><em>Always read product labels and follow the instructions carefully.</em></p>
