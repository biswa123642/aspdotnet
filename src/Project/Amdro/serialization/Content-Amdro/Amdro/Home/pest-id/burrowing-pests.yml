        <h2>BURROWING PEST IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Burrowing pests &mdash; of the furry kind &mdash; can quickly turn your beautiful lawn into a sea of mounded soil and disrupted grass. When this happens, one of these three offenders is likely behind the burrowing mess:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gophers</strong> &ndash; These large, short-tailed rodents average 6 to 12 inches long, depending on the species.     They have prominent, chisel-like front teeth used to feed on roots and other plant parts. Large, powerful     claws for digging line their front feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Moles</strong> &ndash; These midsize tunnel-makers grow 6 to 8 inches long, with small teeth that suit their earthwormand     insect-heavy diet. Their distinctive pointy snout complements their tiny eyes, short front legs and     heavily clawed, mitten-like front feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Voles</strong> &ndash; These pests feed on plants &mdash; from roots to bark &mdash; and grow to about 4 to 8 inches long. Also     known as meadow mice, voles are larger and stockier than <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6E26C1814237485CAE195ABE46E3238E&amp;_z=z">common house mice.</a>&nbsp;They also have shorter legs, fur-covered tails and ears nearly hidden by their longer fur.</li>
        </ul>
        <img alt="" src="-/media/B6692A48CA6A4580895ACF55F1A55680.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-right: 30px; float: left;" />
        <h2>SIGNS OF GOPHERS, MOLES AND VOLES</h2>
        <p> It sometimes takes a bit of digging, but it's relatively easy to identify signs left by gophers, moles and voles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gopher <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C732AD0C0FF47169A06BE74D1C8F8BA&amp;_z=z">mounds</a></strong>&nbsp;are fan-shaped. When viewed from the side,     the dirt slopes upward to one side, away from the pest's hidden hole. Gopher tunnels stay hidden     underground, invisible from above &mdash; unless heavy rains and erosion expose the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Molehills</strong> are round, cone-like mounds that look balanced from all angles. Entry holes sit right in the     cone's center. In addition to hills, moles also make tunnels just under the soil surface. You can see the     raised tunnels from above. Heavy rains may break tunnels open.</li>
            <li><strong>Vole damage</strong> doesn't involve tunnels or mounds. These pests make trench-like, above-ground runs     between their holes. In summer, these pests hide their runways with grass. In winter, their trenches stay     snow-covered until melting reveals the damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL BURROWING PESTS </h2>
        <p>When burrowing pests strike your lawn and landscape, damage occurs above and below ground. Effective control options vary based on the pest and their habits, and your preferences for burrowing pest control. Amdro&reg; brand offers several options to help preserve your peace and property:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8206E6CA588D46AEBA979ECF137C3EEC&amp;_z=z">Amdro Mole* &amp; Gopher&Dagger; Bait</a> comes in an easy-to-use shaker container. The pelletized bait must be placed in mounds, molehills and tunnels to kill moles* and gophers&Dagger;.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D423960D8635412CA09BD6422565C41F&amp;_z=z">Amdro Mole &amp; Gopher Tunnel Trap</a> mimics the dark tunnels that moles and gophers use. The trap captures moles and gophers without chemicals and offers easy, no-touch disposal.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=76EEE595E8A243A49F35EFBFAE134C9E&amp;_z=z">Amdro Mole, Vole &amp; Gopher Blockers </a>protect your plants from damage without killing the burrowing pests. The flexible stainless-steel mesh surrounds and shields plant roots and protects stems and trunks at ground level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>GOPHER, MOLE AND VOLE TIPS </h2>
        <p>When fighting burrowing pests, take steps to protect curious children, pets and other wildlife. Pests killed with bait may die outside their tunnels. Stay vigilant, dispose of dead pests promptly and keep safety foremost in mind.</p>
