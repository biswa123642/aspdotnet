        <h2>SPOTTED LANTERNFLY IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Spotted lanternflies are extremely destructive invasive pests recently discovered in the United States. Despite the moth-like appearance of adult spotted lanternflies, these pests are more closely related to leafhoppers, aphids and stinkbugs. All spotted lanternfly life stages are easily recognizable.</p>
        <p>Adult spotted lanternflies are stout pests that measure 1 inch long and 1/2 inch wide. Their short antennae, black heads and black-banded yellow abdomens combine with pink-tinged, gray forewings spotted with black. A black, brick-like pattern covers forewing tips. Their black-and-white hindwings have bright red, black-spotted patches.</p>
        <p>Immature spotted lanternflies pass through four wingless nymph stages. Through the first three stages, these pests grow up to 1/4 inch long. Called "black-stage" nymphs, they have black bodies and legs spotted with white. During the final nymph stage, these pests grow up to 3/4 inch long. "Red-stage" nymphs are brilliant red and black with white spots.</p>
        <p>Spotted lanternflies lay egg masses on all types of surfaces, including cars, tree trunks, walls, picnic tables and barbeque grills. When fresh, the 1-inch masses look like clay or putty. As they dry, they look like cracked, caked-on mud.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF SPOTTED LANTERNFLIES</h2>
        <p>The first signs of spotted lanternflies are often swarms of the pests themselves. These conspicuous invasives congregate and feed in large numbers. They damage plants by piercing plant tissue and sucking out large volumes of vital plant sap. Affected plants ooze sap, wilt, drop leaves and die back. With severe infestations, plants die.</p>
        <p>Black-stage spotted lanternfly nymphs seek out tender new plant growth. But red-stage nymphs and adults can pierce bark and feed on trees. As they feed, they excrete large quantities of sticky, sweet honeydew that attracts ants, wasps and other pests, and develops into unsightly black sooty mold.</p>
