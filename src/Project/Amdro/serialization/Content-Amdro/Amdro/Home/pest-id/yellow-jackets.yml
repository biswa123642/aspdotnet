        <h2>YELLOW JACKET IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Yellow jackets comprise a group of several wasp species known by their bright yellow-and-black bodies and aggressive behavior. These pests grow up to 1/2 inch long, with markings that vary according to species. Their yellow-and-black body patterns include triangles, spots and varied bands. Unlike fuzz-covered honeybees, yellow jackets have shiny, nearly hairless bodies.</p>
        <p>Aggression toward humans and pets is a primary identifier that distinguishes yellow jackets from their fellow <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D1D81AA812CB4161BBDFF5C41870C93B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">wasps</a>. These pests plague picnics and other outdoor gatherings, harassing guests and feeding on drinks, meats, sweets and almost any food available. Unlike honeybees, yellow jackets can &mdash; and often do &mdash; sting repeatedly when disturbed.<img alt="" height="400" width="400" src="-/media/26545448F8E847FCB89E0B91F00F8D76.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF YELLOW JACKETS</h2>
        <p>Depending on the species, yellow jackets build their papery nests in many different places. Sometimes, the first sign of their presence is a small papery comb built surprisingly close to doorways and outdoor entertainment areas. Other times, you may discover a small hole in your lawn that leads to an underground nest.</p>
        <p>When openings into walls and attics exist, you may see yellow jackets ducking in and out of a structure. They're known to build massive nests in wall voids to accommodate large colonies. In all cases, interactions with humans trigger hostile responses.</p>
