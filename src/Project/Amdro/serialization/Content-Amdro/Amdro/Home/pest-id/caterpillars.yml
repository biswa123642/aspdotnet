        <h2>CATERPILLAR IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>"Caterpillar" is a catch-all name for the immature, larval stage of butterflies and moths. Like the adults they become, caterpillars are an extremely diverse group. Their species range from hundreds of types of small green caterpillars known as "inchworms" to large creatures that grow 4 inches long or more. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=16CD2FD800A248029711C01AA6EB0765&amp;_z=z">Armyworms</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5E80475A8BE44FD0BAF832736F655052&amp;_z=z">cutworms</a>&nbsp;belong to this pest group, as do the following caterpillar pests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tent caterpillars</strong> &ndash; This group of caterpillars weave protective, tent-like webs and grow up to 2 inches     long. Depending on the species, they can have spots and stripes of blue, white, black and orange, with     orange-red hairs covering their bodies.</li>
            <li><strong>Hornworms</strong> &ndash; These bright green caterpillars grow up to 4 inches long and are as thick as an index     finger. Depending on the species, white side markings are V-shaped or diagonal. The posterior "horns"     that inspire their name are typically black or red.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like all insects, caterpillars have six legs. Located right behind their heads, these true legs complement fleshy false legs, called "prolegs," which help support the abdomen. Caterpillars always have some abdominal segments without either kind of leg. Prolegs help distinguish caterpillars from <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E5CFB9EDA0AE4E0C8A3CECF3459FE318&amp;_z=z">beetle larvae</a>&nbsp;and other insect pests.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF CATERPILLARS</h2>
        <p> Caterpillar damage comes in various forms. Depending on the insect involved, these pests may chew flowers, leaves, fruits or grasses. Some types bore into trees and woody shrubs. Leaf-eating caterpillars can be voracious feeders. They chew large, irregular holes in leaves or decimate leaf margins. They'll also consume entire seedlings, leaves and flowers &mdash; and leave large droppings behind.</p>
        <p>Sod webworms, a type of turf-damaging caterpillar, weave silky webs in lawn grasses as they chew off grasses at the base. Other types of turf-injuring caterpillars may chew grass tips or eat grass back to the ground, leaving large patches of yellow or brown grass in their path. Damage is often worse in lawn areas with poor drainage or heavy thatch.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
