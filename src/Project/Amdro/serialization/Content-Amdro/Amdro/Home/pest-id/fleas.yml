        <h2>FLEA IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Fleas are tiny, troublesome, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2969694209B74ACAB098BDE8F7F166F7&amp;_z=z">biting pests</a> that live and feed on animals and humans. Known as ectoparasites, fleas live on the outside of their host. Common fleas have reddish-brown bodies that look flattened from the sides when viewed head on. These pests are about 1/8 inch long when mature and have very large hind legs.</p>
        <p>Though they're often referred to as either "cat fleas" or "dog fleas," these pests aren't picky about their hosts. As long as a blood meal is available, they'll jump up to 12 inches to hitch a ride and find a home. After they feed, their semi-translucent bellies reveal the blood inside.</p>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/B78344B69D1B4E8FAEA436D2DEDC4B5E.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF FLEAS</h2>
        <p> Scratching pets and humans are the first signs of a flea outbreak. Bites often occur on ankles, leaving small, round, bright red marks behind. If you hold an infested animal, bites may occur on your arms or chest. To check your scratching pets for an infestation, groom their fur and then clean the grooming tool over a light-colored cloth. You'll see fleas and their excrement clearly.</p>
        <p>Fleas can transmit pathogens that cause disease in humans, pets and wildlife. Sometimes they transmit these directly through their bites. Other times, pathogens get transmitted indirectly through animals, such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6E26C1814237485CAE195ABE46E3238E&amp;_z=z">rodents</a>, that fleas may bite. If you happen to see wildlife, such as rabbits, scratching furiously, you may have a flea problem in your yard.</p>
