        <h2>GYPSY MOTH IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Gypsy moths are highly destructive invasive pests that damage plants during their<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=68342F7AFED74BE7AAA795E04ADCC141&amp;_z=z" target="_blank"> caterpillar</a> stage. Newly hatched larvae are only 1/4 inch long, but male larvae grow up to 2 inches. Female gypsy moth larvae grow up to 3 inches long. Sometimes confused with tent caterpillars, the larvae have distinctive markings: five pairs of bright blue spots and six pairs of bright red spots run down their backs. Tufts of long hair appear from head to tail.</p>
        <p>Adult female gypsy moths are furry-headed, cream-white moths with 2-inch wingspans. But unlike most moths, these females never fly. You'll typically find females on tree trunks, immediately above masses of brown eggs. Adult males are brown moths with wingspans of 1 1/2 inch. You'll often see these flying males close by females.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF GYPSY MOTHS</h2>
        <p>Gypsy moth larvae are heavy feeders that devour the foliage of hundreds of plant types, but trees are especially vulnerable to these pests. When gypsy moth larvae move into tree canopies, they can defoliate entire trees. Branches appear bare and autumn-like in summer.</p>
        <p>As gypsy moth damage continues, remaining leaves drop. Tree branches begin to die back, and weakened trees may die. A dense layer of caterpillar droppings and leaf debris blankets the area below.</p>
