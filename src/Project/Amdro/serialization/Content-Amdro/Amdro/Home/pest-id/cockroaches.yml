        <h2>COCKROACH IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Known to disrupt homes and businesses &mdash; and carry bacteria, viruses and other pathogens &mdash; cockroaches rank high on the list of the most feared and despised insect pests. The flattened, oval-shaped bodies of common cockroaches typically measure between 1/2 and 2 inches long. They range in color from light tan to dark brown black.</p>
        <p>Cockroaches have spine-covered legs and long, straight antennae. Most, but not all, cockroaches have wings that lie flat against their backs. Even so, they rarely fly. Unlike <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E5CFB9EDA0AE4E0C8A3CECF3459FE318&amp;_z=z">beetles</a>, whose hard, shell-like wing coverings make a distinct sound when crushed, cockroaches don't make that crunching sound.</p>
        <p>Most cockroach problems in U.S. households come from these three species:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>American cockroaches &ndash; The largest of this trio, these roaches grow up to 1 1/2 inches long or more.     Their reddish-brown bodies have a lighter-colored band around the area behind their head. These pests     try to enter houses after heavy rains. They have a taste for sweets.</li>
            <li>Oriental cockroaches &ndash; Often mistakenly called "black beetles," these roaches grow about 1 inch long.     Their glossy bodies are dark brown to nearly black. When temperatures drop, these roaches seek shelter     in homes. They like a high-starch diet.</li>
            <li>German cockroaches &ndash; The most dreaded of all cockroach pests, these prolific roaches grow less than     1/2 inch long. Two distinct dark bands run down their dark brown backs. Females may carry protruding     egg cases that look like extended abdomens. These roaches reproduce year-round indoors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/AF5743DC228E49E8BB9BCBE3CCFF4F8D.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF COCKROACHES</h2>
        <p> Indoors and out, cockroaches seek out damp, cool, dark spaces. Because they're most active at night, they often stay unseen until populations grow. Roach feces, dead roach parts and old egg cases litter roach-infested areas. Fecal smears cover walls and baseboards along their route. Many people have allergic reactions to roach feces; sudden allergies may be warning signs.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL COCKROACHES</h2>
        <p>Roaches are known to frequent sewers and contaminate everything they touch. Protecting your home and family means stopping these pests before they ever invade your home. Cockroaches enter homes through foundation cracks or small openings where electrical or plumbing lines come in. Inspect your foundation and seal any openings.

        <h2>COCKROACH CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Good sanitation is essential to cockroach control. Keep your home and exterior areas free of garbage, grease or decaying materials. If you see one cockroach, more are probably in hiding. For large infestations, call on a pest professional.</p>
