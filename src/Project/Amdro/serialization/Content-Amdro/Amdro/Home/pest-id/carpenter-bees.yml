        <h2>CARPENTER BEE IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Many species of carpenter bees go about their business and never cause problems for people. But Eastern homeowners are all too familiar with carpenter bees that rank as one of America's top wood-damaging pests. One of the largest native bees in the United States, these Eastern carpenter bees grow up to 1 inch long. Often confused with bumble bees, they have black and yellow hairs on their bodies. But while bumble bees have hairy abdomens, Eastern carpenter bee abdomens are shiny and black.</p>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/FB9C40237D7E49C2A767317106A669A9.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS&nbsp;OF CARPENTER&nbsp;BEES</h2>
        <p> Like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A10472F88F84494DBD80D09EBFEF0E61&amp;_z=z">carpenter ants</a>, carpenter bees don't eat the wood they damage. Instead, they excavate extensive tunnels to house their nesting chambers. The first sign of a carpenter bee problem is usually a round, 1/2-inch hole somewhere it's not wanted with a pile of sawdust on the ground below it. Look for excrement stains on the wood below the hole.</p>
        <p>Carpenter bees don't live in large hive-like colonies, but their extended families often remain together in the same spot. As generations multiply, so do their nesting tunnels. A single entry hole may lead to multiple connected tunnels extending 10 feet or more within boards or walls. Weathered, unpainted or unsealed wood is a favorite carpenter bee target.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL CARPENTER BEES</h2>

        <h2>CARPENTER BEE TIPS</h2>
        <p>Male carpenter bees are very aggressive and often dive-bomb people and pets that come near their homes. Despite their aggression, these male bees can't sting, so don't let them deter your treatment. Female carpenter bees can sting, but they rarely do. They try to avoid human contact instead.</p>
