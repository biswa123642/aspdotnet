        <h2>SPIDER IDENTIFICATION </h2>
        <p>Spiders belong to a group known as "arachnids." They're more closely related to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54BA58F839BD4BF28B6FED8BA046882A&amp;_z=z">scorpions</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=49442B08DA9C439BBDBD5AB134FD79FB&amp;_z=z">ticks</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C43748310D744905971E3E50A461CACA&amp;_z=z">mites</a>&nbsp;than insects. Distinguishing spiders from insects starts with understanding their differences.</p>
        <p> Spiders have two distinct body segments: a head-and-thorax segment, known as a "cephalothorax," and an abdomen. Insects have three segments: the head, thorax and abdomen. Spiders have eight legs, six to eight eyes and no antennae, but insects have six legs, two eyes and two antennae. Another key difference is that spiders have fangs instead of insect-like jaws.</p>
        <p> Adult spiders may be as small as a poppyseed or measure several inches across. Their colors and markings vary as well. Some common spiders include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brown recluse</strong> &ndash; Feared for their venomous bites, these spiders grow to 3/4 inch or more. Their bodies range in color from light brown to darkest brown. They're sometimes called violin or fiddleback spiders because of the violin-shaped marking on their backs. Brown recluse spiders have three pairs of eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Black widow</strong> &ndash; Known for sometimes killing their mates, female black widows grow 3/8 inch long or more. Several different regional species exist, but they have brilliant red, hourglass-shaped markings on their dark abdomens. Black widows have eight eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow garden</strong> &ndash; A common sight in gardens and lawns, this spider's body measures more than 1 inch in length. From the top, the females are black with bright yellow back patches and reddish-brown legs. These spiders have four pairs of eyes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In most spider species, males are smaller and less colorful. Baby spiders hatch from egg sacs in large numbers and look like small versions of adults.</p>

        <h2>SIGNS OF SPIDERS </h2>
        <p> Spiders feed on insects, not plants. They're typically found in garden debris or dark, moist spaces where insects congregate. Seeing spiders in your home may signal a bigger insect problem that drew spiders in from the outside.</p>
        <p> Some spiders weave webs to catch their prey, but others hunt their food instead. Signs of indoor infestations include simple cobwebs or intricate webs, and egg sacs filled with new spider generations waiting to hatch.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL SPIDERS</h2>

        <h2>SPIDER CONTROL TIPS </h2>
        <p>Spiders can't get inside unless they have a way in. It takes less than 1/16 inch hole for common spiders to squeeze through. Seal any openings in your home's foundation, and keep your property free of yard and garden debris that attracts insect pests.</p>
