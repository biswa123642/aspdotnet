        <h2>WASP IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Many kinds of wasps, including yellow jackets and hornets, exist in the United States. Different species vary significantly in appearance, but the worst troublemakers for homeowners look very similar.</p>
        <p> Frequently mistaken for honeybees, these stinging wasps have bright yellow-and-black bodies that measure from 3/8 to 5/8 inch long. Unlike fuzzy honeybee bodies, wasp bodies are glossy and nearly hairless. Depending on the species, their body markings include spots, triangles and irregular bands of yellow or black.</p>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/8349720BCBD94C28BCAF95FA39652544.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF WASPS</h2>
        <p> Stinging wasps are social insects that live together in large colonies. Their papery nests appear in trees, along roof lines, tucked into door or window corners &mdash; wherever they want to build. They often seek out spots close to where humans entertain outdoors, and then sweep in to steal food and drink.</p>
        <p> Aggressive behavior &mdash; and stings to people and pets &mdash; are common with these flying pests. Unlike honeybees, which can only sting once, yellow jackets and other wasps can sting again and again. Reactions to their stings can be severe.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL WASPS </h2>
        <p>Treat wasps during their least active times to limit your likelihood of stings. Wasps move more slowly in early morning and late evening hours, so time treatments accordingly. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DE88DBAB9EB64FF58E4383EE202C6F94&amp;_z=z">Amdro&reg; brand</a>&nbsp;products can help you kill wasps and protect your family from their stings:</p>
