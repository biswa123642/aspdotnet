        <h2>MOSQUITO IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>In recent years, mosquitoes have gone from nuisance pests to known vectors of deadly disease. Non-native mosquitoes have joined North American natives and brought new dangers with them.</p>
        <p> Adult mosquitoes grow about 1/4 inch long. These slender pests have six legs, three distinct body segments &mdash; head, thorax and abdomen &mdash; and two transparent, veined wings. Three types of mosquitoes are of special concern when it comes to disease transmission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Culex</em> mosquitoes</strong> &ndash; Typically thought of as common mosquitoes, these brownish pests transmit the     pathogens behind West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis. They typically bite during evening and     nighttime hours.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes</strong> &ndash; These exotic types transmit pathogens associated with multiple diseases, including     Zika virus and dengue. They have striking black and white markings and bite during daytime instead of at     night.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes</strong> &ndash; Also known as malaria mosquitoes, these pests transmit the parasite behind     that disease. Dark brown with four dark wing patches, they hold raise their abdomens high in the air when     they bite and feed in the evening.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some insects, such as crane flies, look similar to mosquitoes. But none of these lookalikes bite and feed on blood.</p>
        <p><a href="-/media/1634EBFF20B7437DA934B4229524C98A.ashx"><img alt="" src="-/media/1634EBFF20B7437DA934B4229524C98A.ashx?h=400&amp;w=400" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 30px;" /></a></p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF MOSQUITOES</h2>
        <p> Buzzing, biting and itchy swollen skin are the calling cards of adult mosquitoes, but it pays to focus on signs of these pests in the early egg stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raft-like clusters of white to brown mosquito eggs that float on top of stagnant water signal <em>Culex</em>     mosquitoes at work.</li>
            <li>White eggs, which quickly turn black, sitting right above the water line in water-holding vessels indicate     <em>Aedes</em> mosquito types.</li>
            <li>Individual eggs that darken in color as they float separately on the water's surface point to <em>Anopheles</em>     mosquitoes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When mosquito eggs hatch, the caterpillar-like mosquito larvae hang suspended by their rears below the water. Common <em>Culex</em> and exotic <em>Aedes</em> mosquito larvae hang perpendicular to the water surface. <em>Anopheles</em> larvae hang parallel to the water line.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES</h2>
        <p>Effective mosquito control targets these dangerous pests as larvae and adults. Larvae-fighting products called "larvicides" kill immature mosquitoes before they reach the flying and biting stage. "Adulticides" work to kill adult mosquitoes before they can bite and transmit pathogens that cause disease.</p>
        <p> Amdro Quick Kill&reg;+ mosquito control products help you fight mosquitoes effectively at both life stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amdro Quick Kill+ larvicide treatments</strong> come in two convenient forms that prevent adult mosquitoes     from developing. Disc-like <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=75524A40749D47F588DCE491F313EA2B&amp;_z=z">Mosquito Bombs</a>&nbsp;treat larger bodies of water, such as water gardens and fish     ponds.

        </ul>
        <h2>MOSQUITO CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Mosquitoes can turn even a thimbleful of water into a breeding ground. Monitor your property carefully and eliminate all unnecessary or undesirable water. Then treat your water features with larvicides to prevent the next adult mosquito generation.</p>
