        <h2>CHINCH BUG IDENTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>As one of the smaller pests to strike your landscape, chinch bugs often escape detection until late in the game. They damage turf in both their immature, wingless nymph stages and as adults.</p>
        <p>The reddish nymphs start out smaller than a pinhead, but quickly mature in size and appetite. A single whitish band circles their waist. As nymphs mature, they grow darker in color until they turn gray.</p>
        <p>Common adult chinch bugs measure about 1/6 to 1/4 inch. Their black bodies have white front wings marked with a black spot each. Folded in place, the wings display a distinctive hourglass design. Some chinch bugs have full wings; some have half wings. Some fly and some do not.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>SIGNS OF CHINCH BUGS</h2>
        <p> As adult chinch bugs feed on lawns, their mouthparts pierce grasses and suck out plant juices. They also release a toxin that prevents plant fluids from flowing normally. Large irregular patches of lawn turn yellow and brown. Sometimes, grass gets a purplish tint. It may look like drought, but watering doesn't help.</p>
        <p>To confirm whether chinch bugs are behind your problems, find a magnifying glass. Spread the grass and zero in on the thatch line. You'll see chinch bugs easily as they congregate, even though they're small. On sunny days, you'll often find them on sidewalks and driveways. They're easy to see there as well.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>HOW TO CONTROL CHINCH BUGS</h2>

        <h2>CHINCH BUG CONTROL TIPS</h2>
        <p>Chinch bugs spend winter in grassy areas and leafy lawn and garden debris. In spring, they emerge, mate and feed. Keep your lawn and landscape well-maintained and excel at fall clean-ups. Eliminate chinch wintering spots, and treat early in the year.</p>
