        <br /><p>If you live in the South, then you are no stranger to insect and animal pests. However, it can be difficult to identify the culprit, and how to get rid of them once you do. Here are the usual suspects, and some tips on how to vanquish them from your lawn and garden.* </p><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">FIRE ANTS AND CARPENTER ANTS: </h2><br /><p>A danger to plants, animals and people, fire ants are particularly invasive in areas with warm climates, such as Florida and Texas. They deliver painful bites that sting, transmitting venom that can be deadly. Fire ants create mounds and can kill trees and non-nuisance wildlife, while carpenter ants, if left untreated, can tunnel into wood-framed homes and create structural problems.</p> <ul>     <li>     <strong>Designation: </strong>harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> For fire ants, use <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B9DA798C78F34CDA96D51784FC232B76&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Amdro Fire Ant Bait</a>, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8379EFC4D6374E7D9839D02C0F8F7096&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Amdro Yard Treatment Fire Ant Bait</a>.

The time it takes to control these pests depends on infestation and yard size. Remember to continue using products as directed.     </li> </ul><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">TOMATO HORNWORMS: </h2><br /><p>Tomato hornworms: A caterpillar with a signature &ldquo;horn" on its head, the tomato hornworm makes quick work of plants, particularly vegetables in the Solanaceous family, including tomatoes. Tomato hornworms are long&mdash;about four inches&mdash;and transform into moths. Because tomato hornworms eat both leaves and fruit, they can decimate crops. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy: </strong>Pick hornworms off plants by hand, and then drown them in a bucket of soapy water; keep your garden healthy and weed-free; and encourage beneficial insects, such as parasitic wasps, by including plants suitable for the region and maintaining a healthy landscape.</li> </ul><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/7528EDF8543949C38B41F155CA86679A.ashx" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Hornworms, if left unchecked, can quickly decimate tomato plants.</em></p><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">GRASSHOPPERS: </h2><br /><p>Hard to catch and voracious, grasshoppers make quick meals of plants and flowers. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> Use Sevin products as directed.
