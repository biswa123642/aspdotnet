        <p>Fleas can infest even the best-groomed, most-loved dogs and cats. If your pet's relentless scratching has you looking for answers, start with your own backyard. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD2D76DF9D3E4FD8B522812259319A88&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Flea infestations</a>&nbsp;aren't just embarrassing; these pests can transmit disease-causing pathogens that strike wildlife, pets and humans.<sup>1</sup> Fleas that pets pick up outdoors often end up indoors, too. By learning to identify flea problems and taking action, you can get rid of fleas and protect your family against their return.</p>

        <p>If you see household pets scratching vigorously and repeatedly, common cat fleas are probably the reason. Don't let the name fool you &mdash; cat fleas afflict dogs, people and other animals along with cats. These tiny, wingless, biting insects measure 1/8 inch or less. That's about the same size as adult <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6B89C6F834814011B544771EAB3DB963&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">deer ticks</a>.</p>
        <p>Fleas are visible to the naked eye, but a magnifying glass provides a more in-depth look. Common fleas have thin, semi-translucent, reddish-brown bodies with flattened abdomens designed for moving through thick pet hair. Like other insects, fleas have six legs, including two large, oversized hind legs. Their beak-like mouthparts pierce the skin of their animal host so they can suck on its blood. After a meal, the red blood shows clearly in flea abdomens.</p>
        <p>If fleas infest your pets, the humans who live with them are fair game, too. Fleas are known to jump 12 inches or more to reach a warm-blooded host. Human flea bites often occur around ankles and calves. The small, circular, bright red bite sites appear in rows along sock tops or in concentrations. If you hug infested pets, expect bites on your neck, arms and chest as well. Human flea bites itch, but reactions in dogs and cats are generally more severe.<sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>Common cat fleas spend almost their entire adult lives living on a host animal. In contrast to internal parasites, these pests live on the outside of their victims. Adult fleas only eat blood.</p>
        <p>Cat flea larvae hatch from eggs and go through three legless, worm-like stages. Then they create cocoons and transform into adult fleas. The sticky cocoons attract a camouflage of dust and dirt before adults emerge. Adult fleas immediately seek out warm-blooded hosts and start feeding on blood. Within two hours, adult fleas mate. Within a day, female fleas start laying eggs.</p>
        <p>Cat fleas feed up to 15 times a day. Female fleas eat up to 15 times their weight in blood daily. A single adult female flea lays up to 2,000 eggs at a rate of up to 40 eggs per day.<sup>1 </sup>The pearl-white eggs fall from the host and develop wherever they happen to land. New generations of fleas mature in just three to four weeks. Then those new adults start feeding, mating and laying more eggs. Several generations can occur each year.</p>

        <p>Effective flea control starts in your yard and kills fleas and flea larvae before they infest pets, come indoors or reproduce. Never apply a lawn and garden flea control product to a pet or person. See your veterinarian or medical doctor for appropriate medicines instead.</p>
