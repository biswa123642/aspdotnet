        <br /><p>The hot, often dry summer weather in the Southwest doesn't deter certain stalwart pests that dine on vegetable crops and flowers. The following pesky visitors are common at this time of year.<sup>*</sup> </p><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">FLEA BEETLE </h2><br /><p>Several species of the flea beetle exist in the southwest. This pest ranges from 1/16 to 1/4 inch long and boasts a variety of colors, including black, yellow and green. The creature's enlarged hind legs allow it to jump like a flea.<sup>1</sup> The pest eats the foliage of a variety of crops, including beans, young corn and potatoes, as well as flowers, such as Mexican primrose and sunflowers. Flea beetle feeding gives plant leaves a tattered look, and excessive feeding can lead to plant death. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> Keep the garden free of weeds, and prune dead and dying plant foliage to help prevent flea beetle establishment.     </li> </ul><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">SOUTHWESTERN CORN BORER </h2><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/28E7EF7F69214749BECD76E1B1FA4FA9.ashx" /><br /><p>The white larva of this destructive pest is 1 1/4 inch long and feeds on sweet corn and popcorn plants. When young, the larva eats leaf surfaces, creating skeletonized areas on the foliage. It may also destroy the tip of the corn cob. As the larva matures, it begins boring into the corn stalks, causing breakage.<sup>2</sup> The 1-inch-long, white adult moth does no damage to plants. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation: </strong>nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> Control reoccurrence by removing all dead plant material after harvest, and then tilling the soil to a depth of 8 to 12 inches.     </li> </ul><br /><h2 style="z-index: 1;">POTATO/TOMATO PSYLLID </h2><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/37E4ECEEA0F9426487521B9D95A14DF2.ashx" /><br /><p>This tiny pest, commonly referred to as the jumping plant louse, is often overlooked until damage has been done. The adult resembles a miniature cicada. It is 1/8 inch long, and dark gray and brown in color. The nymph is smaller. Both are able to jump from plant to plant to feed. When eating, the nymph injects a toxin, which causes plants to yellow and die.<sup>3</sup> This psyllid attacks plants in the potato and tomato family, including eggplant and peppers. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> If you think psyllids have invaded your garden, use yellow sticky traps to verify your suspicion. The yellow color lures the insects onto the sticky surface. These traps are available at home and garden centers.     </li> </ul> <p><em><sup>*</sup>For a quick remedy for most of the pests listed, treat with the wide-reaching <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7E8E0E9854BC404784D72BAD899BA54F&amp;_z=z">Amdro Quick Kill Outdoor Insect Killer (RTS)</a>.
