        <br /><p>Have you noticed tunnels in your yard, yellow leaves, and half eaten vegetables in your garden? You may be aware that you have animal and insect pests, but aren&rsquo;t sure what they are or what to do about them. Insect and animal pests are everywhere; however some regions attract specific types. Below are the most common animal and insect pests of the Pacific Northwest region.* </p> <h2>SLUGS AND SNAILS: </h2> <p>Both shell-less slugs, which are members of the snail family, and shelled snails love the moisture of the Pacific Northwest region and leave behind a slimy trail of damage as they eat through leaves and vegetables. Although the destruction tends to be cosmetic, a severe infestation of either snails or slugs can wreak enough havoc to kill a plant. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> There are several options to get rid of slugs and snails. You can start by applying a slug/snail removal bait product, such as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.corrys.com/all-products/corrys-slug-snail-killer" target="_blank">Corry's Slug &amp; Snail Killer</a>; these easy-to-use pellets work for two weeks. Also consider putting a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.corrys.com/all-products/corrys-slug-snail-copper-tape-barrier" target="_blank">Corry's Copper Tape Barrier</a> around plants; the copper will lightly shock and deter insects.     </li>     <li>There are more labor intensive methods available, too. You can remove slugs and snails from plants by hand first thing in the morning, and then drop them in a pail of soapy water to kill them. Repeat until the pests are no longer present. Finally, encourage birds and beneficial insects by including plants suitable for the region and maintaining a healthy landscape.</li> </ul><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/1CBC0A1A9CEE4D48AA1205A163227F70.ashx" /><br /><p><em>Although slugs can be picked off by hand, it's a tedious, time-consuming task. Pellet bait remedies can help keep these mollusks from destroying plants. </em></p> <h2>APHIDS: </h2> <p>Pests that target inside and outside plants, aphids are small, long-legged insects that feed on leaves. They leave behind a sticky residue that yellows leaves and stunts plant growth.</p> <ul>     <li>     <strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> Encourage beneficial insects, such as lacewings and ladybugs, by including plants suitable for the region and maintaining a healthy landscape. Protect gardens with row covers and remove when plants are healthier. Finally, rinse plants with daily doses of water. If this gentle approach fails, you can also apply a product, such as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gardentech.com/All-Products/sevin-ready-to-use-bug-killer/overview?__hstc=160555618.7dfd00663dde2230943b440c3b1af662.1450296312011.1451423029185.1451486075338.34&amp;__hssc=160555618.5.1451486075338&amp;__hsfp=469037557" target="_blank">Sevin</a>, which can be quickly sprayed on infected plants.</li> </ul><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/57B96A767B8D45FFB2F34F66D8DD8F49.ashx" /><br /><h2>VOLES: </h2> <p>Often mistaken for a mouse, a gopher or a mole, a vole is a small rodent that burrows and eats plants, nuts and roots. The damage caused by voles is three-fold: They girdle trees and seedlings, destroy plants in garden beds, and create extensive tunnel systems that can ruin lawns. In addition, voles are prolific breeders; they can take over landscapes with large infestations. </p> <ul>     <li><strong>Designation:</strong> nuisance and harmful     </li>     <li><strong>Remedy: </strong>Protect trees with wraps, and then adjust the wraps as trees grow. Be sure to maintain a healthy, debris-free yard and use locally-approved baits according to directions.</li> </ul><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/1557517C53EB490CBCEAA5D7FCDAD9B7.ashx" /><br /><i>*Remedy time and difficulty will vary by the size of the garden or yard; most involve taking simple steps. Follow all product label recommendations to ensure the greatest chance of solving the problem.</i>
