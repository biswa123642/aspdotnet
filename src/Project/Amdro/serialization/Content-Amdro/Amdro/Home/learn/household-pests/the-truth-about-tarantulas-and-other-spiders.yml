        <br /><p>Coming across a tarantula unexpectedly can send shivers up your spine. Tarantulas are huge, hairy, and, like many spiders, are often misunderstood. With more than 35,000 spider species worldwide,<sup>1</sup> many myths surround these creatures. Some beliefs about tarantulas &mdash; and other spiders &mdash; are misconceptions, but others bear nuggets of truth. </p> <h2>TRUE OR FALSE?</h2> <p><strong>Tarantulas are aggressive and deadly to humans.</strong> </p> <p><strong>False:</strong> With more than 800 species across the world,<sup>3</sup> tarantulas vary in aggression, but they're normally slow-moving, docile creatures. A tarantula's bite will hurt, but its venom is milder than a typical bee sting.<sup>2</sup> Even so, appearances can be frightening. One South American tarantula known as the Goliath bird-eater has 1-inch-long fangs and an 11-inch leg span. In addition to birds, the Goliath eats bats and other prey.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p><strong>Tarantulas defend themselves by ejecting hairs from their abdomens.</strong> </p> <p><strong>True: </strong>Threatened tarantulas usually run to their burrows to hide. But if cornered, they show their fangs and stand on hind legs. Tarantulas native to the Americas have an additional, porcupine-like defense in barbed hairs on their abdomens. Some species press the barbs into enemies when close enough; others eject them like spears to drive them deeper into their enemies. Tarantulas in other parts of the world don't have these irritating, defensive hairs.<sup>3</sup></p><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/7A5854DEEBEE4596BED9F5D74A283F47.ashx" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Some tarantula species are quite colorful.</em> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Female widow spiders always eat the males after mating.</strong> </p> <p><strong>False:</strong> Black widow females are famous for lunching on their smaller mates, but not all males get eaten; some are quick enough to escape. In several species, females rarely eat their mates, especially in the wild.<sup>8</sup> But the male of the red widow spider actually puts himself into the female's mouth. If she refuses to eat him, he keeps trying until she accepts.<sup>4</sup> Widow spiders rarely bite humans, but their venom causes intense pain.<sup>5</sup></p><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/F3F9D15C8A774DEDA7E49142E86B79B6.ashx" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Only one black widow species regularly eats its mates.</em></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p> <strong>People frequently swallow spiders that crawl into their open mouths when asleep.</strong> </p> <p><strong>False:</strong> Fortunately, entomologists say this is a rare occurrence &ndash; if it ever happens at all.<sup>6,7</sup> Spiders perceive vibrations as signs of imminent danger. So they would likely avoid a sleeping human because of normal breath and heart beat vibrations that occur when dozing. Also, the sensation of a crawling spider would wake most humans.<sup>7,8</sup> In some parts of the world, humans do eat spiders, but they're considered delicacies. </p> <p><strong>Daddy long-legs are deadly spiders that lack fangs long enough to inject their venom.</strong> </p> <p><strong>False: </strong>Several different creatures go by the common name of daddy long-legs. They can bite humans, but their mild venom isn't deadly.<sup>6</sup> One species doesn't even have venom. The common daddy long-legs, also known as the harvestman, isn't even a spider. All true spiders have a two-section body, but the harvestman's body is a single section.<sup>8</sup></p><br /><img alt="" src="-/media/33D708ACFB3B4FBA89A764BC758084EE.ashx" /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Some daddy long-legs spiders aren't really spiders at all.</em> </p> <p>Finding spiders or spider-like creatures in your home can cause distress, but separating fact from fiction can help you stay calm.
