        <div class="panel-body">Formula Preparation<br />
        Please read all the instructions before using the exact Hand Feeding Formula. Use the following chart to mix formula according to the chick's age. It is always advised to weigh formula and water to assure proper concentrations. Volume measurements are less accurate but usually sufficient.<br />
        1. Combine formula and hot water (approx. 120&deg;F) in a clean, sanitized container according to the age chart above. (If your tap water contains bacteria, the use of boiled or bottled water is recommended.)<br />
        2. Mix formula thoroughly and allow it to sit for one minute.<br />
        3. Cool mixture to 105&deg;F (or between 102&deg; - 110&deg;F). Mixture should have the consistency of thick creamy pudding. If a smoother consistency is desired, stir product vigorously at this time, which aids in activating added enzymes.<br />
        Special Notes For Preparation<br />
        IMPORTANT - Do Not Reuse Mixed Formula!! Discard and mix fresh at each feeding.<br />
        For hatch to 2 days old - formula should be made in small quantities and thoroughly stirred before feeding. Separation should be expected and is not a problem at this early stage because primary requirements are for water and water soluble nutrients. After chick is two days old, the food concentration must be increased (see feeding chart).<br />
        Microwaving should be avoided. Microwaving can create "hot spots" in the formula and increase the likelihood of accidental crop burns. If required, limit microwaving (on high) to no more than 5 seconds per 1/2 cup of mixed formula at a time. Be sure to follow this with vigorous stirring before retesting the temperature and feeding. Cover large batches of formula while microwaving to avoid a moisture loss. STIR FORMULA THOROUGHLY TO AVOID POTENTIAL OF BURNING THE CROP. Always test formula for proper temperature before feeding.

        <div id="FeedingInstructions" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">Baby birds should be fed on a routine schedule allowing the chick's crop to empty (or nearly empty) between feedings and to determine if bird is being fed the right amount. This prevents any food remaining too long in the crop and possibly spoiling. If the time between crop emptying suddenly increases, and the crop appears to be slowing down, observe the chick closely. See "IMPORTANT NOTES" regarding crop-slow down.<br />
        <br />
        Depending on feeding practices, exact High Fat Hand Feeding Formula can be used to extend the time between feedings or reduce the total number of feedings per day when compared to other formulas.<br />
        <br />
        1. Feed mixture with a clean, disinfected syringe, spoon, tube, or other comfortable method. A separate implement should be used for each baby to prevent spread of disease.<br />
        2. Dispense food along with the chick's feeding response (rhythmic bobbing motion). This is more natural and decreases the likelihood of formula being inhaled.<br />
        3. Feed until the chick's crop is nicely rounded or it refuses any more food, whichever comes first. Do not overfeed or regurgitation may occur. Generally, each meal should consist of a volume equivalent to 10-12% of the bird's body weight.<br />
        4. Clean and sanitize feeding equipment after use. Clean any spilled food from the chick and change bedding after each feeding. Good hygiene is critical for a baby bird's health.
