        <br /><h2><strong>Congratulations on your New Pet Rabbit!</strong> </h2> Having a new pet can be exciting and confusing, so we are here to help. You want to provide the best care possible for your small animal, which is why our experts have compiled this list of must-haves for your new pet. Rabbits are unique animals that require specific care from their pet parents. Everything from food to habitats should be purchased for your pet rabbit&rsquo;s specific needs. Larger rabbits will have different needs than dwarf rabbits, and long hair rabbits will need different care than short hair rabbits.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A great place to get started is with our new pet checklist for your pet rabbit. All that you need to begin caring for your pet rabbit can be found in our <strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB92723CDDB4440DB8C4BDBE58CDCBC0&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">My First Home Rabbit Starter Kit,</a></strong> and because you also want to provide your rabbit with entertainment, the best nutrition, and an enriching life, check out these products below your pet will love. &nbsp;<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> <br /><br /><image src="~/media/B28CE50C6B334431AEDC684367265795.ashx" /><br /><h3>Must Haves:</h3> <p><strong><br /> Habitat</strong> &ndash; <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/small-animal#facets=Small Animal by Product Type:cages-habitats" target="_blank">Shop All Habitats Here&nbsp;</a></strong><br /> Rabbits should have a safe and secure habitat away from direct sunlight and drafts. It is important your habitat has enough room for your rabbit to eat, sleep, and play. Rabbits love extra room to roam so they will benefit from a play yard that is safe and a secure exercise area.

Your rabbit&rsquo;s habitat should be cleaned at least once a week.&nbsp;</p> <p>If choosing to allow your rabbit to freely roam your home, it is important to pet-proof your home and to ensure he or she is litter trained.
