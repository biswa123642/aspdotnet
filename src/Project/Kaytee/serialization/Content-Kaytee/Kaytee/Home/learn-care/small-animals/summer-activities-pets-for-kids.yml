        <br />Whether your kids are counting down the days to summer break from school or you're pining for those longer warm-weather evenings, your pets are ready to spend them with you! So, why not kick off the summer together? The kids will love the creativity and playtime, you'll cherish the bonding moments, and your pets, well, they simply love it all!<br /> <h1>Decorate the Pet's Home</h1> You're not alone in loving a little refresh around the house. Why not do it for your tiny fluffy friend too? Work together with the kids to make some cute adornments for the exterior of the pet's habitat like a chain of colorful paper links, braided dandelions, or even summer-themed stickers! Just be sure to put the decorations out of reach of the pet, which might be around the base of the habitat, or above the rooftop.<br /> <h1>Build a Climbing Center</h1> Hamsters, gerbils, mice, and most pets love to show off their agility by going, up, up, up! Can you build a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instructables.com/Hamster-Tree-House/" target="_blank">treehouse from wooden popsicle sticks</a> for your pet to explore? Or, carefully stack and arrange <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=9D7B30784EFD4AFB9D258AC305641151&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Big Branch Bites</a>&nbsp;and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=48D27BF1D4CD4A06918A59ACEEF85F90&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Kaytee Apple Orchard Sticks</a>&nbsp;using the bars of the habitat for support to create a funky ladder. As a perk, these wooden structures are also safe for your pet to chew.
