        <br /><br /> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">You and your feathered friend have a lot in common. You&rsquo;re fun, colorful, and love to spend time with people. Another thing you have in common is your space, so you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that your home (in addition your bird&rsquo;s habitat) is safe and comfortable.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Here are tips and considerations for making sure your home is right for your pet bird:</span>&nbsp;</p> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Home Type</span></h3> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Apartments and Condos</strong> Parakeets and budgies are little birds that don't require as much space as the big guys, and don't make a ton of noise. Please note that these apartment birdies will need a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/all-products#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:Cages and Playstands" target="_blank" title="Habitat">habitat</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s longer than it is high so they have space to hop and fly. Other bird species that are suited to apartment living include finches, canaries, and parrotlets.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Single-Family Homes</strong> Larger birds like cockatiels and parrots will need room for a larger cage. They&rsquo;ll also make louder calls and chirps that necessitate a private space, such as a single-family home that doesn&rsquo;t have neighbors immediately nearby.</span></li> </ul> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Older Homes</strong> Many sources suggest that pet birds should be kept away from older paint on trim around windows and doors that may contain lead paint.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Room Features to Note</span></h3> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Ceiling</strong> Fans Even when turned off, ceiling fans present a hazard to our feathered friends. When your bird has out-of-habitat time, keep them away from fan blades!</span></li> </ul> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>New Carpeting</strong> New carpeting may hold hidden dangers for birds&mdash;carpeting will often give off fumes that are deadly to pet birds. Air quality is critical to your pet&rsquo;s health, as noted below.</span></li> </ul> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Temperature and Humidity</span></h3> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Consider where your bird is from originally when setting the temperature for your shared home. (They&rsquo;re parrots, not penguins!) This means keeping your space at a minimum of 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Humidity is an important consideration, as dry air can contribute to dry skin, brittle, breakable feathers, and other ailments. Try an electronic humidifier or a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-pet-birds-require-misting-390670" target="_blank" title="misting schedule">misting schedule</a>&nbsp;to hover around 40-50% humidity and keep your downy dude (or dudette!) comfy.</span></p> <ul> </ul> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong style="font-size: 15.21px;"></strong></span></p> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Air Quality</span></h3> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Smoke</strong> If it&rsquo;s bad for you, it&rsquo;s bad for your bird. Because our avian allies have super-sensitive respiratory systems, they pick up on every household and environmental pollutant they encounter. That means <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span></strong> indoor smoke if you own a bird.     </span></li> </ul> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Cooking Fumes and Other Pollutants</strong> Whether you&rsquo;re frying catfish or painting an old dresser, strong fumes and smells are dangerous to your bird friend. Keep cooking fumes, volatile cleaning products, paint, varnish, and fireplace fumes far away from your bird.     </span></li> </ul> <ul>     <li><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Air Filters</strong> Birds love clean, fresh air as much as humans do, so make sure to change your air filters every 45 days, or according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.     </span></li> </ul> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Noise</span></h3> <p>Your bird loves you, and likely loves your day-to-day noise. That&rsquo;s probably why most birds are excited by household hubbub like talking, singing, or the sound of a vacuum running. However, they are sensitive to overly loud noises from TVs, stereos, construction, or noisy kids. Keep their noise exposure at a reasonable level, and make sure it&rsquo;s only during their waking hours. A bird&rsquo;s gotta sleep, too!</p> <img alt="pet bird" src="-/media/BB578EA1604E4FB58D1B7143ACD6D6B3.ashx?h=263&amp;w=500" style="width: 500px; height: 263px;" /><br /> <p>With these tips on hand (on feather, really) you&rsquo;re equipped to be an expert bird owner and to provide them with a comfortable, safe forever home.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;re ready to make your bird&rsquo;s enclosure perfect, fly on over to our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/all-products/pet-bird#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:Cages and Playstands" target="_blank" title="playstands">cages and playstands</a>&nbsp;.
