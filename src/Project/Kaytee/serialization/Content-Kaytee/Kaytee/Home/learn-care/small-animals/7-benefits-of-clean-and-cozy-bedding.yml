The texture of Clean &amp; Cozy bedding is great for burrowing since it is fluffy and soft. Pets will burrow deep in the bedding to get comfortable.<br /> </span> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma; color: #c00000;">Super Absorbent</span></h3> <span style="font-family: tahoma;">Clean &amp; Cozy paper bedding absorbs 6x its weight in liquid. This means there are fewer messes and moisture in your pet&rsquo;s habitat. One bag can go a long way because it expands to three times its size when out of the package. Your pet will be drier and comfortable in its home as the bedding does what it&rsquo;s designed to do. Watch as our experts demonstrate the absorbency of Clean &amp; Cozy in this video.&nbsp;<br /> </span> <div>&nbsp;</div><br /><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQlImOxlYE0"><br /><h3><span style="font-family: tahoma; color: #c00000;">99.9% Dust Free</span></h3> <span style="font-family: tahoma;"> Paper bedding has gotten a reputation for being dusty.
