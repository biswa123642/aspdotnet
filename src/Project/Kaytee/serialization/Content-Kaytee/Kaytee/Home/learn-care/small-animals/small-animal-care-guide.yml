        <h1>Getting Started With Your New Small Pet</h1>
        <p>The first moments you spend at home with your new furry friend are an important time for you both. Here are some tips to help you start out right.</p>
        <h2>Build Their Home</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Set-up their habitat in a well-trafficked area that&rsquo;s away from direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>Place food, water, bedding and toys in your small animal&rsquo;s new home.</li>
            <li>A clean habitat is essential to the well-being of any small animal. Kaytee offers a complete line of paper, wood, and other natural beddings and litters to keep pets feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Check the area around the habitat to make sure it&rsquo;s free from cords, plants, or other objects your pet might try to pull in.</li>
            <li>Visit the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=745AD4116A9B4B84AE45FC3CB6105A0A&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Kaytee blog </a>to learn more</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The First Couple of Days</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Give your furry friend plenty of time to get familiar with their new home and surroundings.</li>
            <li>Wait a few days before you handle them. You&rsquo;ll know they&rsquo;re ready when they roam around freely in their habitat and regularly come out of their special hiding places.</li>
            <li>Move slowly around your small animal so they don&rsquo;t get startled.</li>
            <li>Every small animal has unique dietary needs. Be sure you are feeding them species specific food.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How To Bond With Your Small Pet</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Take it slow: introduce new people and activities slowly.</li>
            <li>Be a treat dispenser: offering treats (in moderation) is a great way to bond and become friends.</li>
            <li>Accentuate the positive: if your small animal is doing something you enjoy, such as coming to you or performing a trick, reward them with a treat.</li>
            <li>Avoid reinforcing the negative: if your new furry friend is doing something you don&rsquo;t enjoy, do not reinforce the negative behavior by giving them attention.</li>
            <li>Be consistent: make sure the amount of time you spend with your small animal in the beginning will be something you can sustain throughout their lifetime.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Training Your New Pet</h2>
        <p>Certain small animals can be trained. Rats are one of the most intelligent small animals and can learn to navigate mazes and even walk &ldquo;tightropes.&rdquo; Rabbits can be trained to use litter boxes and walk outside on a leash. Guinea pigs can be taught to sit up and beg for food. However, these tricks take continued time and patience to teach your small animal so don&rsquo;t give up right away. Always use positive reinforcement. If your small animal enjoys being touched, praise him with extra cuddling. If your pet is food motivated, grab a favorite treat.</p>
        <h2>Signs of a Healthy Pet:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear bright eyes</li>
            <li>Smooth shiny coat</li>
            <li>Eats regularly throughout the day</li>
            <li>Normal feces&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Interactive and curious attitude</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Veterinarian:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Appetite loss along with weight loss</li>
            <li>Depressed behavior</li>
            <li>Abnormal feces or diarrhea</li>
            <li>Discharge from nostrils or mouth along with irregular breathing</li>
            <li>Abnormally unkempt coat</li>
            <li>Overgrown teeth or nails</li>
            <li>Abnormal lumps or bumps</li>
        </ul>
