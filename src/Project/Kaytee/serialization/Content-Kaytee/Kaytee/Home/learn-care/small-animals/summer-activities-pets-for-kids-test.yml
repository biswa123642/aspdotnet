So, why not kick off the summer together? The kids will love the creativity and playtime, you'll cherish the bonding moments, and the pets, well, they simply love it all!</p> <h2>Decorate the Pet's Home</h2> <p>You're not alone in loving a little refresh around the house. Why not do it for your tiny fluffy friend too? Work together with the kids to make some cute adornments for the exterior of the pet's cage like a chain of colorful paper links, braided dandelions, or even summer-themed stickers! Just be sure to put the decorations out of reach of the pet, which might be around the base of the habitat, or above the rooftop.</p> <h2>Build a Climbing Center</h2> <p>Hamsters, gerbils, mice, and most little critters love to show off their agility by going, up, up, up!
