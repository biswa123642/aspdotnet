        <br /><h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">&nbsp; </h1> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">During a time when everyone could use a little extra help The Kaytee Animal Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing people&rsquo;s knowledge and enjoyment of animals, is proud to give back to three very deserving organizations that are helping our healthcare heroes and deserving animals in need of support. </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">The first organization Kaytee is supporting is Froedtert &amp; the Medical College of Wisconsin, a teaching hospital located in Milwaukee with a mission of patient care, innovation, medical research and education. Froedtert &amp; MCW is an internationally recognized training and research center engaged in thousands of clinical trials and studies.</p> <p>&ldquo;In a time of such sacrifice and uncertainty, I&rsquo;m extremely grateful <span style="color: black;">for the generosity from all of the Rapid Response Fund donors who enhance our ability to navigate the outbreak of COVID-19 in our region,&rdquo; said Cathy Buck, MSN, RN, President</span>,<span style="color: black;"> Froedtert Hospital. &ldquo;Like our healthcare professionals, our community supporters have stepped up wonderfully during this public health crisis.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span style="color: black;">With the donation from Kaytee, the hospital will help provide comprehensive support for Froedtert &amp; MCW physicians, staff, and faculty, including childcare services, mental health services, emergency lodging and meals, procurement of personal protective equipment, and more.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Kaytee Animal Foundation is also donating to two organizations dedicated to supporting rabbits, Bunnies and Beyond Inc. and House Rabbit Society Wisconsin Chapter. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Bunnies and Beyond is a</span> New York City (NYC)<span style="color: black;"> adoption and educational non-profit organization dedicated to the rescue, proper care, and ultimately, the adoption of rabbits. Their goal is to find permanent indoor homes for animals that have been abandoned or surrendered to the </span>NYC<span style="color: black;"> Animal Care Center, providing medical care and a foster home as needed prior to adoption. They also provide lifelong support to adopters. The donations received from the Kaytee Animal foundation will help with the spay or neutering of the rabbits that are rescued by the organization. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">House Rabbit Society Wisconsin</span> Chapter<span style="color: black;"> is dedicated to rescuing homeless rabbits and to providing education and outreach on rabbit care. Their mission is realized through the efforts of numerous volunteers, and regular activities, but unfortunately due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of their fundraising efforts, such as their popular Bunny Days and Hoppy Hours, have been canceled. This donation will help the organization procure new, sterile, easy-to-clean cages.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">If others would like to donate to these wonderful organizations, please find the links below: </span></p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span style="color: black;">Bunnies and Beyond, Inc:&nbsp; </span><span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bunniesandbeyond.org/" target="_blank">https://www.bunniesandbeyond.org/</a></span></li>     <li><span style="color: black;">House Rabbit Society Wisconsin Chapter </span><span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=" https://wisconsinhrs.org/" target="_blank">https://wisconsinhrs.org/</a></span></li>     <li><span style="color: black;">Hospital Donation Milwaukee </span><span style="background: #fefefe; color: #0a0a0a;">Froedtert Hospital </span><span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.froedtert.com/giving/foundation/direct-your-gift" target="_blank">https://www.froedtert.com/giving/foundation/direct-your-gift</a></span></li> </ul> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Additional information about Kaytee</span> Animal Foundation <span style="color: black;">can be found here:&nbsp;</span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C28499A0A0094348BE881BB8AA0AD2BD&amp;_z=z"><span style="color: #009578;">https://www.kaytee.com/about/avian-foundation</span></a></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #009578;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #009578;"><img height="495" alt="Kaytee Animal Foundation Donates $10K to Three Deserving Charities " width="494" src="-/media/396F0A74723343DEA32BD7F8620215E9.ashx" /></span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #009578;">&nbsp;</span></p>
