        <br /><strong></strong>Heck, no! They're furry, gentle creatures that make engaging house pets for us to adore. <h2> What Are Rabbits?</h2> <p>Technically speaking, rabbits are classified as mammals. This means they are warm-blooded, have fur or hair, and have live births &ndash; and don't lay eggs as the Easter Bunny might suggest. Rabbits have short fluffy tails, cute wiggly noses, a soft fur coat, strong hind legs for jumping, and can weigh anywhere from 2 to 16 lbs, depending on age and type. <br /> <br /> Did you know they are fast runners too? Rabbits can zip along as quickly as a car at 35-45mph when they want to get somewhere fast! Maybe that's why Bugs Bunny can outsmart (and outrun) his cartoon friends. <br /> <br /> As you research pet rabbits, you might come across the names of some popular breeds including Dutch Rabbits, Holland Lops, Mini Rex and Netherland Dwarfs. These are all small varieties that stay under 6 lbs when mature, making them the perfect size to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB92723CDDB4440DB8C4BDBE58CDCBC0&amp;_z=z">keep in your home</a>.</p> <h3>Why Rabbits Make Good Pets</h3> Rabbits are smart, quick learners, and love to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6108213B44504BB6ACAE681FED8EF2E9&amp;_z=z">play with their human friends</a>. You can build obstacle courses for them to navigate, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=363C196841C0444B8DB3EBE527DE048C&amp;_z=z">hide treats</a>&nbsp;to encourage their natural foraging instincts or even read books to them to keep them happy and content. <br /> <br /> Rabbits have delicate bones, so it's best to introduce a bunny to a home with middle school-aged or older children. They also make great pets for people who simply want a furry friend to nap on their lap while they watch television or read a book. <br /> <br /> Are you considering adding a new pet to your home?
