        <br /><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Before you can bring a bird into your home, you must purchase everything you will require for his care.</strong> Fortunately, all the items your pet will need should be available from your local pet store. The following are the basic must-have supplies.</span> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/pet-bird?__hstc=27337699.b3e3189e40bb9260ac6ca101463bf9c6.1514922779866.1515102897738.1515613744343.7&amp;__hssc=27337699.7.1515613744343&amp;__hsfp=3983846368#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:Cages &amp; Playstands" target="_blank">Bird Habitats</a></span></h3> <span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;"> The size of the habitat you need will depend on the bird (or birds) you plan to keep, but a good rule of thumb is to house your bird in the largest habitat that you can afford and have room for in your home. (If you can't purchase or place a very large habitat, you shouldn't acquire a large bird.)&nbsp; </span> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Your habitat should be square or rectangular rather than round to provide your pet with more room to fly and move. Also, the bars should be evenly spaced, not tapered toward the top. In a habitat with tapered bars, a bird can get his toe, wing, or even his head caught where the bars come together, causing serious injury. The habitat should also have a removable grate at the bottom (usually made of metal) above the habitat tray that catches the bird's waste and prevents him from getting to it.<br /> <br /> The habitat itself should be made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic (combo habitats for small birds only). Stainless steel (best), powder-coated steel (better), and galvanized after weld (good) suitable habitat materials—other metals may contain harmful toxins that your bird could ingest. Acrylic habitats can also work well for smaller birds because the solid walls prevent mess, but moisture can build up in the habitat if it doesn't have adequate ventilation.&nbsp;<br /> <a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/pet-bird?&amp;__hstc=27337699.b3e3189e40bb9260ac6ca101463bf9c6.1514922779866.1515102897738.1515613744343.7&amp;__hssc=27337699.7.1515613744343&amp;__hsfp=3983846368#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:Cages &amp; Playstands" target="_blank"><img alt="Bird Cages" src="-/media/26D7A3708DA841EBB082FE4E7921ACEA.ashx?h=464&amp;w=404&amp;hash=8FEE74F4D786F3A8AD75953797342E8F191AC403" style="height: 464px; width: 404px; top: 369px;" /></a></span></p> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/pet-bird?__hstc=27337699.b3e3189e40bb9260ac6ca101463bf9c6.1514922779866.1515102897738.1515613744343.7&amp;__hssc=27337699.7.1515613744343&amp;__hsfp=3983846368#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:Bedding &amp; Litter" target="_blank">Bird Bedding and Habitat Lining</a></span></h3> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"> A variety of materials can be used to line your bird's habitat, but the best options are newspaper or commercial bird litters such as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kaytee Walnut Litter</span></strong>.

Soft fabric carriers are popular, but if your bird is ill they are difficult to disinfect.&nbsp; Plastic airline kennels are also practical and easy to disinfect if needed. It should also have adequate ventilation and a place to put food and water dishes. If you plan to travel with your pet, select a model which will fit under the seat of an airplane.</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">It’s important to make the carrier a safe and desirable destination, this can be done by using it as a place to offer treats and allow your bird to walk in on its own to fetch those treats.&nbsp; If a bird is caught up and placed aggressively in the carrier, it will quickly become a scary place they don’t want to go and each time will become harder and harder to get your bird into it.&nbsp;</span></div> </div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> </div>
