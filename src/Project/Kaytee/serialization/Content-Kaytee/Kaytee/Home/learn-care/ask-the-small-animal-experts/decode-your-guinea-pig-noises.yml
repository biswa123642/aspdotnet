But that’s not the only noise our pets make. Have you heard your guinea pig make a </span><span style="font-family: tahoma;">chut</span><span style="background-color: inherit; font-family: tahoma;">? Or purr?&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </span> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">We have compiled a list of common guinea pig noises to help you better understand your pet’s needs. While we can’t speak “guinea pig,” we can learn more about our pets to better take care of them in need and bond with them when they are content.</span></p> <p><span style="background-color: inherit; font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Use these tips below to better understand how your pet guinea pig is feeling or trying to communicate.&nbsp;</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Chirrup:&nbsp;</strong><br /> This sound indicates disturbance or being mildly upset. You might hear it when they are bothered by something going on. It can also be sometimes used for attention. If your guinea pig is feeling neglected, you might hear a couple chirrup noises as they seek their owner’s attention.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chut:&nbsp;</strong><br /> The chut is a common noise made by guinea pigs to themselves and each other. It indicates contentment in their home or surrounding. Owners often hear chuts when a guinea pig is out of their habitat exploring.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chutter:&nbsp;</strong><br /> If you hear a chutter sound, you might want to be cautious. This could indicate mild unhappiness due to another guinea pig near them or something else. They typically don’t want to be bothered when they make this noise. These chutter noises are sometimes followed by a whine.<br /> <br /> <strong>Drrr:<br /> </strong>When your guinea pig is startled, they will likely make a drrr sound. This is their version of the expression “Ah” or “Wow” when they hear a loud noise or something disturbs them unexpectedly. When this noise is made, most guinea pigs will freeze in place since they are scared.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Scream:&nbsp;</strong><br /> Guinea pigs with scream when they have a fright or when they are in a fight with another animal. Pay close attention to your pet if you hear a scream.<br /> <br /> <strong>Squeal:</strong><br /> Some guinea pigs will squeal when they are experiencing potential pain or they need attention. It can sometimes be that another guinea pig is stealing his favorite spot to eat. Pay attention to your guinea pig if you hear a squeal because it could indicate that they need help from something hurting them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Tweet:</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Tweets are made by younger guinea pigs after nursing. This noise occurs after they have relieved themselves. You likely won’t hear this from an adult guinea pig.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wheek:&nbsp;</strong><br /> As mentioned before, a wheek indicates excitement for being let out, food or play. Owner’s will hear their guinea pigs wheek when they are about to be fed, if they hear their favorite treat bag, or when they are excited to play with something. On the contrary, a low wheek usually means that they owner is on their way over to the habitat and the make this sound until they are reunited with their owner or guinea pig buddy.<br /> <br /> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaytee.com/special-offers?__hstc=27337699.f0910523122023bb96c8666461318fbb.1492023263020.1492110595297.1492116635932.4&amp;__hssc=27337699.7.1492116635932&amp;__hsfp=1474604506" target="_blank">Sign up for our newsletter</a>&nbsp;or like us on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/KAYTEEpets/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;for more pet information or tips!<br /> <br /> Please note that all pets are unique.
