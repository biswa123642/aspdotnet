        <br /><p> </p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Pay close attention to your yard this spring for new bird species and entertainment all season long! </strong>As you watch birds return to your yard, or sometimes leave your yard to go even further north, read through these fun facts about bird migration. You might learn something new!</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Hummingbirds are the smallest migrating bird<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">With an average weight of 1/8 of an ounce, Hummingbirds are the smallest migrating bird. They can travel as fast as 30 mph (48 kph) when migrating. Their migratory path takes them across the Gulf of Mexico twice a year. They fly this nonstop, which can be as far as 600 miles. That’s a long journey for such a small bird!</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><strong style="font-family: tahoma;"><img alt="Migratory Hummingbird" src="-/media/F55AD0DB71744598963E7A14DFC360FF.ashx?h=565&amp;w=750&amp;hash=ED9CD41E0FBAAC1804524DB588A25B8203A3BF83&amp;hash=ED9CD41E0FBAAC1804524DB588A25B8203A3BF83" style="height: 565px; width: 750px;"></strong><br> <br> <br> 2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Migrating birds can travel VERY far<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Birds in migration can travel as far as 16,000 miles. To reach their destination in time, some travel at speeds of 30mph. At this speed, birds take up to 533 hours to reach their final destination. Traveling 8 hours a day, it would take some birds 66 days to reach their migration destination. This means the birds have been traveling a long time by the time they get to your backyard! Make sure they are welcomed with fresh food and water when they arrive.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Some birds migrate at high altitudes<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Not all birds travel low where we can see them. Songbirds travel at an altitude as high as 500 to 2,000 feet. Geese and vultures have been known to travel at altitudes of 29,000-37,000 feet high. Some scientists believe that birds travel at higher altitudes to conserve energy with less flapping of the wings and more gliding. They move up and down altitudes to gain boosts of natural lift from the changes in density.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Migrating birds know where to go<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Instinctively, migrating birds know where to migrate and how to navigate back home. They use the stars, the sun, and earth’s magnetism to help them find their way. They also almost always return home to where they were born. Because of this, you could be right if you think you see the same bird each year in your yard.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><img alt="Bird Migration Facts" src="-/media/60AF7990A03C481D85777C2B93EB7B13.ashx?h=411&amp;w=730&amp;hash=B72F09DDDBCFBA378FA3B8C96260D42676D65E50&amp;hash=B72F09DDDBCFBA378FA3B8C96260D42676D65E50" style="height: 411px; width: 730px;"><br> <br> 5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Birds prepare for migration<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">To help birds prepare themselves for the long journey away from home for the winter, they build up body fat. They fuel up with certain foods and reserve up to 50% of their body weight. It is important to feed birds all year long, but especially when they return from migration and when they are preparing to leave for migration. They will be hungry!</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Birds migrate at different times<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Have you ever wondered what time birds migrate? When most of us are making our morning and afternoon commutes to and from work, migrating birds are feeding and resting. Many birds migrate during the night. They do this for a variety of reasons. At night, the air is cooler which eliminates the need to stop as much to cool down in water. Similarly, at night there are fewer predators and visibility of these predators is low. Birds are more safe traveling when their predators are resting. This is not the case for all birds, as you typically see geese and cranes migrate during the day.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Wisconsin is a popular migratory destination state<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">In May, a popular migration month, it is estimated that 3 million birds cross the Wisconsin state border daily as they migrate back to their Wisconsin homes. And this is on a light night! On heavy migration days, there can be as many as 30 million birds migrating into Wisconsin during the spring season. Do you live in Wisconsin or the Midwest?

Their biggest threats on the long journey home in the spring include predators like owls or hawks, dehydration, starvation, oil drilling rigs in the ocean, windmills, power stations, and drastic climate changes. All of these hazards are instinctually taken into consideration, but birds are still not completely safe during their journey.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><img alt="Migratory Oriole" src="-/media/92C4D7559FFB4D4DB570DBEB9F9CF93E.ashx?h=469&amp;w=750&amp;hash=7C0053E32D2AEDD6AB03E079CF044168002C2FD0&amp;hash=7C0053E32D2AEDD6AB03E079CF044168002C2FD0" style="height: 469px; width: 750px;"><br> <br> 9.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Neotropic birds are a type of migratory bird<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Neotropic birds are birds migrating from neotropic areas in Central America and South America. Birds that are considered neotropic migrators include the Northern Oriole, the Baltimore Oriole, the Indigo Bunting, the Rose-Breasted Grosbeak, and the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong><br> 10.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Birds need specific items when landing in yards after migration<br> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: tahoma;">Most importantly, birds need food, water, and nesting materials. They will be very hungry after exerting energy to travel those long distances. They could be facing dehydration if they don’t drink enough water after finishing their migration flight. And they will be ready to lay their eggs. By providing nesting materials in your yard like string, hay, pet hair, strips of fabric, and natural sources of twigs or moss, birds will be able to build their nest in time to have their babies.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><br> </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><strong>Now that you’ve learned something about the birds migrating to your yard, go get ready for them!
