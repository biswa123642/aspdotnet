Some beddings are scented, some come in different colors, and superior odor control benefits for fun foraging. Whatever you decide to get your pet, make sure you have it ready when building your CritterTrail.<br /> <br /> You will also need fresh water. Fill the water bottle with water that you would drink yourself before installing it in the CritterTrail. Pets need lots of fresh water, you&rsquo;re their only source! It is important that your pet has enough water to drink throughout the day and night.<br /> <br /> Pick out a food that is right for your pet. Whether you have a mouse, a hamster, or a gerbil, there are foods crafted specifically to fulfill each species&rsquo; nutritional needs. There are different levels of food that offer a variety of health benefits, so check out our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6B435E748A7C4B398E6B7E1066A8914E&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Choosing The Right Food blog</a>&nbsp;to learn more about the different options for your pet.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Crittertrail habitats are designed to connect to other Crittertrail habitats to create endless customization and increase living space.&nbsp;Other accessories that will take your pet&rsquo;s home to the next level include second habitats which can be connected with tubes, Loop-D-Loop accessories, a Lazy Look-Out accessory, LED lights, and more. These accessories provide more space for your pet to explore, burrow, and run around, keeping them active and healthy in their home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Please remember that out-of-habitat time is important for all pets. Pets need attention, love, and close monitoring when they are out of their habitats exploring or roaming around your space in a toy like a run-about ball.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Once you have your bedding, water bottle full of clean, fresh water, and a bag of food, you&rsquo;re ready to build your habitat!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The full assembly instructions come in every box, but if for some reason, you need access to instructions, they are provided below.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaytee.com/-/media/files/kaytee-na/pp1000613_ct_starter_instru pdf.pdf?la=en&amp;__hstc=27337699.f6bd88d641d0ae69cc3dff8a558d71f2.1503691382632.1503691382632.1503937893006.2&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1503937893006&amp;__hsfp=3469296807" target="_blank">(Link to PDF Instructions)</a></span></strong><br /> <br /> Instructions for all habitats we offer are available for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaytee.com/learn-care/ask-the-kaytee-experts/assembly-instructions?__hstc=27337699.f6bd88d641d0ae69cc3dff8a558d71f2.1503691382632.1503691382632.1503937893006.2&amp;__hssc=27337699.51.1503937893006&amp;__hsfp=3469296807" target="_blank">download here.</a></span></strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Once you&rsquo;ve read through the instructions, take a look at this video as we build the habitat step-by-step!
