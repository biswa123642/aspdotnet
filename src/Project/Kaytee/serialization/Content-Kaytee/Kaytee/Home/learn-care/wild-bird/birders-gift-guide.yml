Try shopping for bird neck ties, ornaments, artwork, jewelry, calendars, or coffee mugs. Some birders love birds so much they want them all over their house in the form of d&eacute;cor, too! <h3>A mounted and framed bird picture they&rsquo;ve taken</h3> Make it personal and have a photo they&rsquo;ve captured made into a custom print or canvas. Frame it and present it as a thoughtful gift to display in their home. <h3>Birding books</h3> Get your loved one a bird book they can enjoy about their favorite hobby.
