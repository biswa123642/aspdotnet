        <br /><p> </p> <p> Summer is a spectacular season for birds, and knowing how to feed birds in summer will not only attract hungry feathered guests to your yard, but will nourish seasonal visitors, growing hatchlings, and every summer bird that stops by for a snack. From the best foods to the right feeders, birders who take steps to meet summer birds' nutritional needs will be rewarded with many more birds to enjoy throughout the season.</p> <h3>The Foods Summer Birds Need</h3> <p>By the beginning of summer, migratory birds will be back in your yards. To attract these new visitors, it&rsquo;s important to provide a variety of rich, nutritious foods during the busy summer months. One of the most sought-after foods in summer is insects, as they provide essential protein and energy for nestling growth, feather development, and adult birds molting their plumage. <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4B58038FFB684D6EBD5E910D5AFC042B&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Mealworms</a>&nbsp;are a great protein source for birds, including seed and suet cakes that include mealworms, such as the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=34FA72547586457CA55E96288B383E87&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Songbird Seed Cake with Mealworms</a>. Peanuts are another great source of protein, and can be offered to birds whole, as hearts, or in seed or suet cakes.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Birds need long-lasting energy for summer's long days to keep them fueled for all their daily tasks, including preening, staying alert for predators, nest repair, foraging for their families, and more. In addition to insects, seeds and grains, including seed blends such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B43EAF922441416EA4F11B46FDD7720F&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Kaytee&rsquo;s Birders' Blend</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F07E31075A19448985396A5369BA0C3A&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">Songbird Blend</a>, are superb energy sources, as is straight <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=56E3DBD945F749458FAF50246C796445&amp;_z=z" target="_blank">black oil sunflower seed</a>.<br /> <br /> Quick, sweet snacks provide fast energy to keep birds active and alert. Many summer birds, like hummingbirds and orioles, are attracted to nectar and fruit feeders. For a quick energy burst, Kaytee ElectroNectar is a great choice to fill hummingbird feeders to both feed and hydrate thirsty birds. Other foods great for summer birds include jelly and fruit, like oranges and cherries.<br /> <br /> In addition to supplemental foods, birds will forage widely for natural foods throughout the summer. Planting native plants that support native insects helps ensure summer birds have ample food supply. Plants such as seed-bearing and nectar-rich flowers, nut or berry bushes, and seed-bearing grasses can help birds find even more food year-round. Providing water is also one of the biggest attractions for birds in the summer.&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Kaytee How To Feed Birds in Summer" src="-/media/D1A8B1C9A71B428289D1962369AEFA4F.ashx" width="500" height="363" />&nbsp; <h3>Tips for How to Feed Birds in Summer</h3> <p>Feeding a variety of foods will help to attract a range of bird species and offering those foods in different ways can help birds feel comfortable and safe while feeding.
