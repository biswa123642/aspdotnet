        <br /><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><br> Woodpeckers are striking birds with their bold feathers. Some have red highlights, some have black and white stripes, and some even have a more solid coloring that can be seen from a longer distance. One thing these woodpeckers have in common is that they can all start to look the same if you don’t know your birds.&nbsp;<br> <br> Our Kaytee wild bird experts are here to help you distinguish between two commonly mistaken birds: the Downy Woodpecker and the Hairy Woodpecker. To start, let’s test your knowledge! Can you tell which one is which from the two photos below?<br> <br> If you look closely, there are some minor visible details differentiating the two. The Downy Woodpecker is on the left and the Hairy Woodpecker is on the right! Luckily, you will have more clues than just looks when spotting birds in the wild. Sounds, geographic region, and favorite foods can help distinguish a bird’s species.&nbsp;<br> <br> How can you really know which is which when you see these birds in your backyard? Use these tips and tricks for these commonly confused woodpecker species.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit; font-family: tahoma;"><br> Downy Woodpecker Characteristics:</span><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><br> </span> <ul>     <li>     <h4><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">•&nbsp;</span>Shorter Beak</span></h4>     <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">From a distance, this is one of the characteristics that can help you determine which species of woodpecker you are looking at.

Both birds are found in North America all year long. They have black and white coloring, and the males have red accents. Both birds hang around the trunks and branches of trees. They have a rise-and-fall flight pattern, a style that they share with most other woodpeckers.<br> <br> Both species enjoy sunflower seeds and suet from feeders. A large part of their diet is wood-boring insects from the trees they famously peck. Many people find them to be helpful in insect control.<br> <br> When you know the main differences between the two birds, you can start to identify which birds are visiting your yard.<br> <br> If you are looking to find bird seed or suet to attract more woodpeckers, locate a store near you that sells <a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products">Kaytee Wild Bird Products</a>.</span> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;"><br> </span></div> <br>
