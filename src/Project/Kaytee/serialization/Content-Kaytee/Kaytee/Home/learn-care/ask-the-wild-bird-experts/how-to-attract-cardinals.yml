We have compiled the best tips and tricks to help these beautiful birds find your feeders.&nbsp;</span><br> <br> <h3>Pick the Right Bird Feeder</h3> <span style="font-family: tahoma;">Cardinals are medium-sized birds. Small feeders and tube feeders are not the right fit for these backyard visitors. Cardinals are more likely to visit a feeder that they feel secure on. Their weight is heavier than other small birds so they prefer standing feeders compared to hanging feeders. Make sure there is a perch and a tall enough area for the Cardinals to land and eat.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: tahoma;">The best feeders to use are </span><a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/wild-bird/kaytee-cedar-bird-bath-or-feeder?__hstc=27337699.eb673f3f63ff2ae79e81e7c4e11c1d5e.1493822906782.1493822906782.1493993032505.2&amp;__hssc=27337699.2.1493993032505&amp;__hsfp=3273345334" target="_blank" style="font-family: tahoma;">platform feeders like this one</a><span style="font-family: tahoma;">.

They are not known to be picky. They eat birdseed along with insects and select fruits. Natural fruits that attract these birds include blueberry bushes, mulberry trees, and other dark-colored berries.&nbsp;<br> <br> Bird seeds that have been known to attract Cardinals include black oil sunflower, cracked corn, suet, Nyjer<sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">®</span></sup></span><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;seed, mealworms, peanuts, safflower, striped sunflower, and sunflower hearts and chips.

Plant shrubs, trees, and bushes around your yard to provide natural hiding and nesting areas for these birds.&nbsp;Another tip for creating a welcoming environment is to put some seeds on the ground below a new feeder. Doing this will help Cardinals flying overhead find the feeder in your yard.&nbsp;<br> <br> Make sure you offer resources in your yard all year long. Cardinals are non-migrating birds, which means they will be looking for food in summer, fall, winter and spring. They will stay in yards that provide what they need. If feeders go empty however, they are likely to move elsewhere to find better, more reliable food and water.&nbsp;<br> <br> </span> <p><span style="background-color: inherit; font-family: tahoma;"><img alt="Attracting Cardinals to your Yard" src="-/media/97FF698F378144A0AB424E500FCF3E6E.ashx?h=501&amp;w=730&amp;hash=0BDDE68FAF85BA69D7D39AE4F6B2DAFF770A1DFB" style="height: 501px; width: 730px;"><br> </span></p> <h3><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Offer Running Water</span></h3> <span style="font-family: tahoma;">It is essential to offer all necessary resources for wild birds in your yard. Cardinals will look for running water, especially in the winter months when non-frozen water is hard to find. Since Cardinals do not migrate, make your yard a resource for them all year long, even on those cold days!&nbsp;<br> <br> Are you ready to make some changes or additions to your yard for those Cardinals? And remember, when you see a male or female Cardinal, during mating season, the other one is likely&nbsp;to be close by.<br> <br> If you are looking to stock up on the right supplies for Cardinals, <a href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products">find a store near you that sells Kaytee Wild Bird Seed</a>.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <br> Additional Sources:&nbsp;<br> <a href="https://www.wildaboutbirds.com/read/attracting-birds/how-to-attract-northern-cardinals-to-your-yard" target="_blank">How to attract Northern Cardinals to your yard</a><br> <a href="http://www.birdsandblooms.com/birding/birding-basics/attracting-finches-catching-cardinals/" target="_blank">Birding Basics to Attract Cardinals</a></span>
