        <br /><p>Among wild birds, 15 species are officially called canaries, all of them small finches in the bird family Fringillidae. Many other species, especially those  with bright yellow feathers, may also be called canaries as nicknames, but they are not technically part of the canary family. However, the island canary (Serinus canaria) is a true ancestor of today's pet canaries.</p> <h2>Canary Traits</h2> <p>Often called the “common canary” or “Atlantic canary”, this bird has been bred domestically for centuries. And today, more than 200 breeds of domestic canaries are kept as pets worldwide. All pet canaries, however, share similar traits that make these small, charming birds instantly recognizable.</p> <h3>Canary Colors</h3> <p>The original wild canary is a bright yellow bird with gray-black streaking on the back. Domestic canaries come in a wide range of colors, from yellow, white, and greenish shades to bolder red and even black. Their markings vary, and some pet canaries can have patchy or blotchy appearances. Their feathers are almost uniformly smooth, though some breeds have short crests, frills, or even mop-like feathering on their heads. These birds aren't usually chosen for appearance but are favorites because of their stunning voices.</p> <h3>Canary Sounds</h3> <p>All types of canaries have melodious songs and elaborate whistles. Their cheerful voices are one of their most endearing characteristics, though they do not mimic unusual noises and cannot speak words. They can become quite noisy, especially mature male canaries that may be looking for a mate. All canaries become more vocal in the spring as changing daylight levels trigger their mate-seeking instincts. Females tend to sing somewhat less, but all canaries are adept songsters.</p> <p> </p> <h4>Canary Size</h4> <p>These are smaller birds, averaging just 4 to 5 inches in length with an 8  to 9 inch wingspan. This smaller size means canaries are ideal for owners with limited space that could not accommodate larger pet birds. Of course, a larger habitat will give even a small bird more space to explore, but if space is at a premium, a canary can be a great pet bird choice. <br /> <br /> Canaries are also cleaner than larger pet birds. They tend to throw less debris out of their cage and are less likely to shred toys or papers in their cage. This helps minimize the necessary cleanup for a canary's habitat making it easier to provide these birds with proper care.</p> <h4>Canary Diet</h4> <p>The pet canary's small, triangular bill is ideal for eating insects, fruits, and plants in the wild, and a pet canary should have a varied diet to ensure their nutritional needs are met. Approximately  80% of your canary’s diet should be fortified food, and 20% can be small bits of fruits or vegetables, with seed s as an occasional treat. Canaries are especially fond of millet sprays. All pet birds, including canaries, should always have access to plenty of fresh , clean water.</p> <h4>Canary Toys</h4> <p>It is important to provide a variety of appropriate toys to keep your canary engaged and happy . These small birds do not require large, elaborate play items, but they will enjoy different perches, especially natural twigs and branches for enrichment. Mirrors, bells, and swings are other great toys for pet canaries, and they will happily flit about their cages perching here, there, and everywhere as they investigate different toys.</p> <h4>Bonding With Your Pet Canary</h4> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Pet canaries adapt best to new families if they are adopted as young chicks, but even adult canaries will grow to bond with their owners. Keeping the bird nearby is essential, as the more a canary is around you, the stronger the bond will become. Positioning the cage in a busy family room will acclimate the bird to their family flock and will provide mental stimulation with different noises. Whistling and talking to a canary can also help them feel more comfortable. </span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">It's best to keep canaries on a schedule, particularly for mealtimes and bedtimes. Using the same whistles or sounds at each feeding time can help the bird recognize the schedule, and they will learn to respond appropriately. In time, canaries can even be hand-tamed for holding and perching on fingers, especially if they're rewarded with their favorite treats.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">A canary may not be the most glamorous pet bird, but these sweet singers are excellent (and popular) choices for beginning bird owners or anyone who would like an easy-going feathered friend.</span></p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> PetMD - The 8 Most Popular Pet Birds<br /> Canary Bird Info - Is Canary a Good Pet?<br /> PetCo - Canary Care Sheet<br /> &nbsp; <div class="telerik_paste_container" style="border-width: 0px; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; left: 4px; top: 18px; width: 1px; height: 1px;"> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;"> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Before you can bring a bird into your home, you must purchase everything you will require for his care. Fortunately, all the items your pet will need should be available from your local pet store. The following are the basic must-have supplies.</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Habitat</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">The size of the habitat you need will depend on the bird (or birds) you plan to keep, but a good rule of thumb is to house your bird in the largest habitat that you can afford and have room for in your home. (If you can't purchase or place a very large habitat, you shouldn't acquire a large bird.)</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Your habitat should be square or rectangular rather than round to provide your pet with more room to fly and move. Also, the bars should be evenly spaced, not tapered toward the top. In a habitat with tapered bars, a bird can get his toe, wing, or even his head caught where the bars come together, causing serious injury. The habitat should also have a removable grate at the bottom (usually made of metal) above the habitat tray that catches the bird's waste and prevents him from getting to it.</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">The habitat itself should be made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic (combo habitats for small birds only). Stainless steel (best), powder-coated steel (better), and galvanized after weld (good) suitable habitat materials—other metals may contain harmful toxins that your bird could ingest. Acrylic habitats can also work well for smaller birds because the solid walls prevent mess, but moisture can build up in the habitat if it doesn't have adequate ventilation.&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Bedding/Habitat Lining</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">A variety of materials can be used to line your bird's habitat, but the best options are newspaper or commercial bird litters such as Kaytee Walnut Litter. Both are safe, inexpensive, easy to replace, and clearly show a bird's droppings, which can be important for monitoring his health. (A change in droppings may indicate a potential health problem.)&nbsp; If you suspect health issues due to dropping appearance, place wax paper down as a liner to get a really good look at the droppings.&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Food and Water</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Stainless steel is the ideal material for food &amp; water cups because it's easy to scrub and disinfect. Although your habitat may come with a couple plastic cups, these can become scratched, allowing bacteria to grow in the crevices.&nbsp; Birds can also be taught to use a water bottle, ensuring they cannot reach it and chew through it.&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Food</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">For long-term good health provide a balanced diet, preferably a pelleted of extruded diet.&nbsp; Supplement with fresh vegetables and fruits depending on the species.&nbsp; High value items like high fat seed and nuts make excellent training treats.&nbsp; &nbsp;A seed mix diet may be deficient in minerals, especially calcium, as well as vitamins and amino acids, so mineral block or cuttlebone should be provided.&nbsp; This should not be necessary if the bird is eating primarily a pelleted or extruded diet.</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">A breeding female may need additional calcium to form eggs.&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Perches</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Perches can be made of natural branches, wood, plastic or PVC, rope, concrete, or pumice. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Offer your bird perches of assorted materials which vary in diameter. A bird who stands on the same perch consistently may develop foot disorders, especially if it is hard and abrasive or too large for its feet.&nbsp; Ideally the foot should wrap approximately ¾ of the way around the perch.&nbsp; Change out the perches, as you do bird toys this way a bird that likes to stand in the exact same spot will be forced to stand on a different perch.&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Bird Bath</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Birds bathe in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Some birds love to be misted with fine mist from a bottle of warm water, others love to bathe in a shallow bowl while others still will like to join you in the shower!&nbsp; That’s right, you can purchase a shower perch and let your bird spend quality time with you.&nbsp; Baths are very important to a birds’ health, remember many birds come from a tropical climate that is very humid and wet.&nbsp; Play with bathing to find out which way your bird likes best, you want bathing to be enjoyable – not stressful!&nbsp; Bathing supplies can be purchased at your local pet store or department store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Toys and Enrichment</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Most birds benefit from having items in their habitat to keep them active and entertained. A wide variety of toys are available, and different birds enjoy different types of toys.</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Provide a variety of toy types for your bird in the habitat setup: thinking toys (items that stimulate his mind); action toys (items that make a lot of noise or require your bird to move); comfort toys (items that your bird can enjoy calmly and quietly); and toys to destroy (items he can chew to keep his beak in good condition).&nbsp; You’ll quickly see which toys your bird prefers and this will allow you to keep him well entertained.&nbsp; A bored bird can quickly pick up bad, remember birds in the wild are very active and are ever moving and foraging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">There are other ways to enrich your bird’s life than just toys, although toys are a necessary item! You can purchase or play video’s for your birds with other bird sounds or just interesting audio.&nbsp; A more current approach is to enrich your bird by providing foraging opportunities, treats hidden within toys or homemade items such as a cardboard tube and coffee filters.&nbsp; Be creative, but safe!</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Travel Carrier</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">A travel carrier is necessary for taking your bird to the vet's office and other places. Soft fabric carriers are popular, but if your bird is ill they are difficult to disinfect.&nbsp; Plastic airline kennels are also practical and easy to disinfect if needed. It should also have adequate ventilation and a place to put food and water dishes. If you plan to travel with your pet, select a model which will fit under the seat of an airplane.</span></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">It’s important to make the carrier a safe and desirable destination, this can be done by using it as a place to offer treats and allow your bird to walk in on its own to fetch those treats.&nbsp; If a bird is caught up and placed aggressively in the carrier, it will quickly become a scary place they don’t want to go and each time will become harder and harder to get your bird into it.&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> </div> </div> <div class="telerik_paste_container" style="border-width: 0px; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; left: 4px; top: 33px; width: 1px; height: 1px;"> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;"> <div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Before you can bring a bird into your home, you must purchase everything you will require for his care.

Fortunately, all the items your pet will need should be available from your local pet store. The following are the basic must-have supplies.</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Habitat</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">The size of the habitat you need will depend on the bird (or birds) you plan to keep, but a good rule of thumb is to house your bird in the largest habitat that you can afford and have room for in your home. (If you can't purchase or place a very large habitat, you shouldn't acquire a large bird.)</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Your habitat should be square or rectangular rather than round to provide your pet with more room to fly and move. Also, the bars should be evenly spaced, not tapered toward the top. In a habitat with tapered bars, a bird can get his toe, wing, or even his head caught where the bars come together, causing serious injury. The habitat should also have a removable grate at the bottom (usually made of metal) above the habitat tray that catches the bird's waste and prevents him from getting to it.</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">The habitat itself should be made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic (combo habitats for small birds only). Stainless steel (best), powder-coated steel (better), and galvanized after weld (good) suitable habitat materials—other metals may contain harmful toxins that your bird could ingest. Acrylic habitats can also work well for smaller birds because the solid walls prevent mess, but moisture can build up in the habitat if it doesn't have adequate ventilation.&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Bedding/Habitat Lining</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">A variety of materials can be used to line your bird's habitat, but the best options are newspaper or commercial bird litters such as Kaytee Walnut Litter.

(A change in droppings may indicate a potential health problem.)&nbsp; If you suspect health issues due to dropping appearance, place wax paper down as a liner to get a really good look at the droppings.&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Food and Water</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Stainless steel is the ideal material for food &amp; water cups because it's easy to scrub and disinfect.
