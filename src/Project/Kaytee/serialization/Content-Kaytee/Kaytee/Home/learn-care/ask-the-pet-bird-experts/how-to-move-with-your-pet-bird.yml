        <br /><p>Pet birds are sensitive to change, making a move to a new home a potentially stressful situation. As a good pet parent, you&rsquo;re already on the right track by looking into the best way to move your pet. With these tips, you can be even more prepared by taking the proper steps to ultimately alleviate stress your pet bird may experience as you move from one home to another.</p> <p>Throughout the entire process, remember to keep calm and maintain close attention on your bird for any concerning changes in behavior like loss of appetite, change in feathers, or aggression. They can pick up on your tone and body language, which can unknowingly defer stress to your bird.</p> <p>Start the moving process by going through these steps. Your feathered friend will be grateful for a smooth transition to a new home.</p> <h3>Type of Transportation</h3> <p>First consider how you&rsquo;ll be making the move: by car or by plane. Car is best as you can be close to your pet bird for the duration of the trip. But if you have to fly to your new home, check with your airline about the proper paperwork and transportation carrier needed. Before booking your flight, be sure the airline accepts birds as some do not. Try getting a carrier that is designed to reduce risk of injury during turbulence and allows enough space for your pet to be comfortable.</p> <p>You&rsquo;ll likely need to make a visit to your vet to get health certificates or to show proof of ownership. If you&rsquo;re concerned about making the move yourself, there are professional pet moving services that are equipped to handle pets of all species, shapes, and sizes.</p> <p>When traveling by car, try to make it as similar to your bird&rsquo;s daily routine as possible. Bring <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaytee.com/all-products/pet-bird#facets=Pet Bird by Product Type:food" target="_blank" title="their typical food">their typical food</a> and water, keep their favorite snacks on hand, and make sure the temperature feels the same as it would in their normal habitat. While it&rsquo;s great if they can see out the window, it&rsquo;s important your bird is not exposed to direct sunlight for extended amounts of time. Bring a blanket or window cover to block light if needed.</p> <p>For your bird&rsquo;s safety, get a car carrier or cage that they&rsquo;ll ride in during the road trip. To reduce stress, purchase the carrier weeks before the move to introduce your bird to the new space. Try having them spend time in it and place their favorite toys throughout the space for comfort. If they have never been on a car ride, take short rides with your bird to slowly introduce them to the feeling of being in the car.</p> <p>Never place your bird&rsquo;s car carrier or habitat in the front seat as the air bag could cause harm in the case of an accident. Keep the carrier secured in the back seat. Also do not pack other items around it that might shift or fly around during the ride.</p> <h3>Preparing for the Move</h3> <p>Long before the moving truck arrives, have everything prepared. When packing up items, only keep essentials in their carrier. Loose items could be dangerous during travel as items shift in turbulence or car rides. Pack all other non-essentials in a separate moving box that you can unpack right when you get to your new location. Get their favorite fruits that are high in water content as fresh water might easily spill in the natural movement of a car or plane.</p> <p>During the loud packing and moving of furniture and boxes, keep your bird in a quiet room to avoid the commotion. This can help reduce stress by keeping your bird away from the chaos. Also try feeding them <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C64EF579838247F1B248E01B4B77B58C&amp;_z=z" target="_blank" title="food">food with additional nutrition</a> during periods of stress to enhance their feather coloring.</p> <h3>Find a New Veterinarian</h3> <p>Take time to research a new veterinarian close to your new home before moving. If your bird experiences symptoms of prolonged stress after settling into your new home, you&rsquo;ll want to have a new vet picked out. You can even schedule a visit before your move for a week or so after the moving day. Use this visit as a general health check for signs of stress.</p> <h3>Settling into Your New Home</h3> <p>After making the move, get settled as soon as you can with your pet in their new space. Try to set it up similar to their previous space for familiarity. Like you did for the packing, when unpacking, keep your bird in a quiet space away from the chaos. The movement of unpacking and extra people in and out could cause stress.</p> <p>Keep your demeanor calm, watch your bird closely, and prepare properly for a smooth transition to your new residence. A strong bond with your pet bird will help keep their energy positive as you move in to a new place together.</p> <p>Sources:</p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.moving.com/tips/moving-with-birds/" target="_blank" title="moving-with-birds">https://www.moving.com/tips/moving-with-birds/</a></p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://moving.tips/diy-tips/how-to-move-with-pet-birds/" target="_blank" title="how-to-move-with-pet-birds">https://moving.tips/diy-tips/how-to-move-with-pet-birds/</a></p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Pack-and-Move-Your-Bird" target="_blank" title="Pack-and-Move-Your-Bird">https://www.wikihow.com/Pack-and-Move-Your-Bird</a></p> <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pbspettravel.co.uk/blog/4-tips-travelling-cage-birds/&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank" title="4-tips-travelling-cage-birds">https://www.pbspettravel.co.uk/blog/4-tips-travelling-cage-birds/</a></p><br /><image src="~/media/6B02C950D59648D4A2222F7ECBAF0E9C.ashx" />
