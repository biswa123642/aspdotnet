        <br />All 50 states have designated state birds, feathered ambassadors that represent each state. Some birds were chosen for their unique abilities, such as the bold personality and exceptional mimicry of the northern mockingbird, the official state bird of five southern states. State birds may also be chosen to raise awareness of the species, such as the nene, Hawaii's state bird. The nene is endangered and only found in Hawaii, making it a perfect choice for the state's official symbolic bird.<br /> <br /> In some states, school contests, conservation group campaigns, or media promotions have helped choose state birds, and the birds may be selected because they are familiar and widespread, making them easy for all residents to see and enjoy.<br /> <br /> These symbolic birds are often showcased on flags, emblems, coins, or seals, and engender state pride and recognition. While some states share feathered ambassadors &ndash; the popular northern cardinal is honored in seven states &ndash; each state bird is a fine representative for its state and a wonderful symbol to learn about.<br /> <br /> <em>Note: Years indicate when each bird was officially adopted in that state.</em> <h2>Alabama</h2> <p><strong>Northern Flicker (1927)</strong><br /> Nicknamed the &ldquo;yellowhammer&rdquo;, this yellow-shafted subspecies of the northern flicker is Alabama's official state bird, not to be confused with the red-shafted northern flicker, which is found in the west, not in Alabama.</p> <p><img alt="Kaytee US State Birds Alabama State Bird" src="-/media/8120CA9FA3AC4348A7B53308E483F35C.ashx?h=500&amp;w=500" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;" /></p> <h2>Alaska</h2> <p><strong>Willow Ptarmigan (1955)</strong><br /> These birds stay in Alaska year-round, and their pure white winter plumage is perfect camouflage during long, harsh winters.

Its influence has become so significant that it has earned the honor as the state's official bird.</p> <p><img height="342" alt="Kaytee blog US State Birds South Dakota State Bird" width="500" src="-/media/B895001F69E84A9C8E12069490B710A6.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Tennessee</h2> <p> <strong>Northern Mockingbird (1933). Also honored by Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, Texas</strong><br /> In a state well known for its vibrant music scene from Nashville to Memphis, it is perfect that the northern mockingbird &ndash; which can learn up to 200 songs &ndash; is the official state bird.</p> <p><img alt="Kaytee US State Birds Arkansas State Bird Florida State Bird Mississippi State Bird Tennessee State Bird Texas State Bird" src="-/media/1C7F4CFC726F413EA5606AC3F887C77C.ashx?h=333&amp;w=500" style="height: 333px; width: 500px;" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Texas</h2> <p> <strong>Northern Mockingbird (1927). Also honored by Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee</strong><br /> The bold personality of the northern mockingbird, with its extensive song repertoire and aggressive posturing, goes perfectly with the adage that &ldquo;everything's bigger in Texas.&rdquo;</p> <p><img alt="Kaytee US State Birds Arkansas State Bird Florida State Bird Mississippi State Bird Tennessee State Bird Texas State Bird" src="-/media/1C7F4CFC726F413EA5606AC3F887C77C.ashx?h=333&amp;w=500" style="height: 333px; width: 500px;" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Utah</h2> <p> <strong>California Gull (1955)</strong><br /> The California gull was chosen as Utah's state bird because a flock of gulls destroyed locusts that threatened Mormon pioneers' crops in 1848, the year after pioneers arrived in the state.</p> <p><img height="332" alt="Kaytee blog US State Birds Utah State Bird" width="500" src="-/media/689E06BCE14140E19B7900AB24042478.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Vermont</h2> <p> <strong>Hermit Thrush (1941)</strong><br /> Vermont legislators initially resisted choosing the hermit thrush because it migrates away from Vermont in winter. Because the bird is found throughout the state in the spring and summer, however, it still secured the honor.</p> <p><img height="333" alt="Kaytee blog US State Birds Vermont State Bird" width="500" src="-/media/101C580F95E54759B4197E4EBD0B0704.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Virginia</h2> <p> <strong>Northern Cardinal (1950). Also honored by Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia</strong><br /> Another name for the northern cardinal is the &ldquo;Virginia nightingale,&rdquo; making it the ideal choice as Virginia's state bird, though Virginia was the last state to give the cardinal this honor.</p> <p><img height="381" alt="kaytee blog us state birds illinois state bird indiana state bird kentucky state bird north carolina state bird ohio state bird virginia state bird west virginia state bird" width="500" src="-/media/8492F98E7AAA4546BDB47F9DF6D75B6F.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Washington</h2> <p> <strong>American Goldfinch (1951). Also honored by Iowa, New Jersey</strong><br /> The western meadowlark was actually the first choice for Washington's state bird but was rejected because other states had already selected it. Today, the American goldfinch is also honored in Iowa and New Jersey.</p> <p><img height="333" alt="Kaytee blog us state birds iowa state bird new jersey state bird washington state bird" width="500" src="-/media/4FF48144DEB146ACA7BD009F03CBF1B6.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> West Virginia</h2> <p> <strong>Northern Cardinal (1949). Also honored by Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia</strong><br /> Though West Virginia became a state in 1863, long after its neighbor Virginia (which became a state in 1788), it selected the northern cardinal as its state bird the year before Virginia did so.</p> <p><img height="381" alt="kaytee blog us state birds illinois state bird indiana state bird kentucky state bird north carolina state bird ohio state bird virginia state bird west virginia state bird" width="500" src="-/media/8492F98E7AAA4546BDB47F9DF6D75B6F.ashx" /><br /> <br /> </p> <h2> Wisconsin</h2> <p> <strong>American Robin (1949). Also honored by Connecticut, Michigan</strong><br /> Wisconsin held surveys of schoolchildren in 1926 and 1927 to decide on a state bird, and while the American robin was popular, it wasn't officially designated until 1949.</p> <p><img height="333" alt="Kaytee US State Birds Connecticut State Bird Michigan State Bird Wisconsin State Bird" width="500" src="-/media/A4382F9C795C496B97A41C7BBF154695.ashx" /><br /> &nbsp;</p> <h2> Wyoming</h2> <p> <strong>Western Meadowlark (1927). Also honored by Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon</strong><br /> The western meadowlark is a bold and popular bird, which is proven by its selection as the state bird of six different states, second only to the northern cardinal.</p> <p><img height="347" alt="kaytee blog us state birds montana state bird nebraska state bird north dakota state bird oregon state bird wyoming state bird" width="500" src="-/media/B8F7245852394367A460E1D364135D69.ashx" /></p> <div>&nbsp;</div>
