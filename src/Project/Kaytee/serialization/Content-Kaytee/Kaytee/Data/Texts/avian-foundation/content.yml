        <p>The Kaytee Animal Foundation is a nonprofit corporation that enhances people's knowledge and enjoyment of companion animals. The foundation supports education, conservation, and research projects locally and globally.</p>
        <p>For example,&nbsp;birds protect our world’s food supply by consuming huge quantities of pest insects, they warn us of dangers in our streams and rivers, and they connect us daily to the beauty and mystery of nature’s web of life. Some songbird populations have decreased and habitat loss and many other factors play a key role in the decline of bird populations.</p>
        <p>In our homes, companion animals are part of our families, bringing us so much enjoyment. Several studies have shown that companion animals reduce stress and help us relax.</p>
        <p>You can help make a difference: saving habitats and supporting educating and learning about companion animals and wild bird populations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/about/contact-us">Contact us</a></span> to discover ways to get involved with the Kaytee Animal Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
