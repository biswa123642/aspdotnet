      Hint: ProfileDescription
      Value: <p>Georgia started her career at Farnam in 2021 as a Marketing and Innovation Specialist. Georgia is an Arizona native who has spent some time in Texas while attending Baylor University. While at Baylor, she was a member of the NCEA Equestrian Team. Georgia grew up around horses and found her passion in the Reined Cow Horse discipline. Georgia&rsquo;s horses, Matt and Bee, are no strangers to Farnam products. You can always find the Slick &lsquo;N Easy grooming block and Vetrolin Liniment in her tack room, not only keeping them looking good but also feeling good. Georgia&rsquo;s goal at Farnam is to make sure every horse feels and looks their best whether in the show pen, retired in the pasture or spending time on the trails.</p>
