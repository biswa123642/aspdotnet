        <p><span>It&rsquo;s not unusual for a horse to cough and there are numerous reasons this can happen. Just as with humans, a cough can be as simple as a reaction to dusty conditions or the sign of something serious. </span></p> <p><span>So why is your horse coughing and how do you know if it warrants a visit from the veterinarian?</span></p> <p><span>When Armon Blair, DVM, of Ocala Equine Hospital in Ocala, Florida, gets a call from a client about a coughing horse, there are several questions he asks up front:</span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span>What is the horse&rsquo;s age?</span></li>     <li><span>Does the horse have a fever?</span></li>     <li><span>When does the horse cough?</span></li>     <li><span>Is the coughing at a certain time of year?</span></li>     <li><span>How frequent is the cough?</span></li>     <li><span>What is the character of the cough?</span></li> </ul> <p><span>The answers to these questions help the veterinarian determine if an exam is advisable.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;A coughing horse is a very common call for veterinarians, and the range of coughing is huge,&rdquo; says Blair. &ldquo;Most of the horses I see for coughing aren't infectious but are allergic and caused by environmental issues.&rdquo;</span></p> <h2><strong><span>What is the horse&rsquo;s age?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>&ldquo;The age of the horse will put the veterinarian&rsquo;s thought process in a certain direction,&rdquo; says Blair. &ldquo;If a foal is coughing, it&rsquo;s more likely a sign of sickness. When an adult horse is coughing, allergies are the most common cause in horses I see.&rdquo;</span></p> <h2><strong><span>Does the horse have a fever?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>&ldquo;Any time you have a coughing horse, you want to take his temperature to check if he has a fever,&rdquo; says Blair. &ldquo;A fever isn&rsquo;t always associated with a cough, but a lack of fever doesn&rsquo;t mean the cough is not infectious.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p> <p><span>Many horse owners don&rsquo;t take temperatures unless they suspect illness. You should <a href="https://www.farnam.com/stable-talk/vitals-guide">take your horse&rsquo;s temperature</a><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span>often enough that you have a baseline for what is normal for him. This way you&rsquo;ll know if he&rsquo;s running a fever.</span></p> <h2><strong><span>When does the horse cough?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>Is it when he&rsquo;s eating grain or hay? When he&rsquo;s exercising or being ridden? When he&rsquo;s at rest?</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more common for an owner to call with concerns because their horse is coughing during feeding time and when exercising,&rdquo; says Blair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less common but more concerning if the horse is at rest and coughing.&rdquo;</span></p> <h2><strong><span>Is the coughing at a certain time of year?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>Is it just seasonal at a specific time of year, or does the horse cough year-round?</span></p> <p><span>Coughing only at a certain time of year is more indicative of allergies than illness.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;In Florida, we have a big run on fall allergies when certain weeds are blooming,&rdquo; notes Blair. &ldquo;I see many more allergy-related issues with horses in the fall than in the spring, which is typically the opposite of human allergies.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Blair points out that during winter months in cold climates, coughing from dust and mold is common because horses often spend more time shut up in a barn.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Dust, mold and ammonia in a closed-up environment can contribute to coughing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When horses are outside and in a mild climate, I find that coughing is more often caused by environmental issues.&rdquo;</span></p> <h2><strong><span>How frequent is the cough?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>&ldquo;If the horse typically coughs two or three times when you start longeing or riding him and then quits, it&rsquo;s likely not serious,&rdquo; says Blair. &ldquo;More concerning would be a cough that is persistent or very deep.&rdquo;</span></p> <h2><strong><span>What is the character of the cough?</span></strong></h2> <p><span>Is it a light, hacking cough or is it a deep cough?</span></p> <h2><strong><span>Exam for the coughing horse</span></strong></h2> <p><span>If your answers to the above questions prompt your veterinarian to schedule an exam, it will typically involve some or all of the following:</span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span>Taking the horse&rsquo;s temperature</span></li>     <li><span>Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope</span></li>     <li><span>Drawing blood to run a complete blood count (CBC)</span></li>     <li><span>Performing an endoscopy&nbsp; </span></li> </ul> <p><span>If these steps reveal no definitive reason for why the horse is coughing, a further diagnostic exam could include:</span><span></span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span>Performing a transtracheal wash followed by lab culture and cytology </span></li> </ul> <p><span>&ldquo;Whenever I'm examining a horse for coughing, I always take his temperature to check for fever, and then listen to the chest (lungs) with a stethoscope to check for abnormal sounds,&rdquo; says Blair.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;I may also pull blood for a CBC to see what white blood cells are present. Sometimes allergies can be detected this way,&rdquo; he notes, adding that blood test results can also indicate if an infection is present.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;We may also do an upper airway endoscopy, or &lsquo;scope&rsquo; the horse, looking for mucus in the trachea. Sometimes scoping can reveal the cause of a cough. For example, if there is infection in the guttural pouches, mucus can drain into the pharynx and cause coughing,&rdquo; Blair explains.</span></p> <p><span>If the veterinarian is still unsure of the reason for the horse&rsquo;s coughing, a transtracheal wash is usually the next step. Blair says that rather than a first choice, this is typically a &ldquo;down the road&rdquo; option for veterinary diagnostics when an infectious lung disease is suspected.</span></p> <p><span>For this procedure, the horse is sedated and a local anesthetic is used as well. A small incision is made in the neck so sterile saline can be injected through a catheter into the lungs via the trachea. Fluid is then aspirated out and is sent to a laboratory for culture and cytology evaluation. The results of the lab work will enlighten the veterinarian as to further treatment and any necessary medication.</span></p> <h2><strong><span>Treating the cough</span></strong></h2> <p><span>&ldquo;You don't want to overtreat an occasional cough,&rdquo; says Blair.</span></p> <p><span>If a veterinary exam reveals that the coughing is caused by allergies, one of the first lines of defense is to treat the horse with antihistamines.</span></p> <p><span>Any other treatment or medication would be recommended by your veterinarian for your horse&rsquo;s specific situation.</span><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span><span>You may also want to try an over-the-counter cough remedy, like Farnam&rsquo;s</span><span style="color: #3366ff;"> <a href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/supplements/cough-free">Cough Free<sup>&reg;</sup></a> </span><span>respiratory health pellets.</span></p> <h2><strong><span>Smart Horsekeeping </span></strong></h2> <p><span>Do your part to make sure stable management practices aren't contributing to your horse&rsquo;s coughing.</span></p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">     <li><span>Keep horses outside as much as possible.</span></li>     <li><span>Use the cleanest, least dusty bedding you can get. </span></li>     <li><span>Clean stalls well every day and remove ammonia-soaked bedding. </span></li>     <li><span>Put horses outside while you&rsquo;re cleaning stalls and aisles.</span></li>     <li><span>Don't sweep or blow out the barn while horses are inside.</span></li>     <li><span>Don&rsquo;t store hay or straw in loft areas directly over stalls.</span></li>     <li><span>Ventilation is crucial! Don&rsquo;t seal up barns tightly, even during the winter.</span></li> </ul> <div> <div> <div id="_com_1" language="JavaScript"> </div> </div> </div>
