        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black;">Whether you blame it on climate change, increased deer numbers, movement of horses for sport and pleasure &mdash; or all the above &mdash; the fact remains that Lyme disease in horses is on the rise.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span>Named for the town in Connecticut where it was first diagnosed in the mid-1970s, Lyme disease is one of the three main tick-borne diseases that can infect horses. Equine piroplasmosis and Anaplasmosis are the other two. Humans, dogs and cats can also be affected by Lyme disease.</span></p>
        <p><span>It's worth noting that, although some people refer to it as "Lyme&rsquo;s" disease, this is incorrect.</span></p>
        <h2 style="background: white;"><strong><span style="background: white; color: black;">Transmission</span></strong></h2>
        <p style="background: white;"><span>Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks carrying </span><em><span>Borrelia burgdorferi, </span></em><span>an infective organism known as a spirochete that is specifically found in the tick species <em>Ixodes scapularis </em>(black-legged tick) and <em>Ixodes pacificus </em>(western black-legged tick), both of which are commonly referred to as "deer ticks."</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">"Where&nbsp;ticks are&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">active&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">year-round, then transmission&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">can be</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;year-round, but as tick 'questing' activity&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">intensifies</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;[in the </span><span style="color: black;">spring</span><span style="color: black;">], transmission is reported as increased," notes&nbsp;Eric Lockwood Swinebroad, DVM, Dipl. ACVIM.&nbsp;A&nbsp;board-certified&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">equine internist</span><span style="color: black;">,&nbsp;Swinebroad was one of seven&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">specialist&nbsp;co-authors of</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement &ldquo;Borrelia burgdorferi Infection and Lyme Disease in North American Horses."</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;</span><span style="color: black;">If&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">it takes weeks for antibody levels to rise, and if the disease is in fact due to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">the host immune response to the spirochete,</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;then it could take weeks for signs to be seen," says Swinebroad, who&nbsp;operates Newmarket/Indialantic Equine, a sport horse practice specializing internal medicine</span><span style="color: black;"> and lameness</span><span style="color: black;"> based in New Hampshire and serving clients throughout New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">Texas</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;and Florida.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">"The Northeast, Upper Midwest and California-Pacific Northwest are&nbsp;considered&nbsp;endemic regions," notes&nbsp;Swinebroad,&nbsp;adding that Florida is likely&nbsp;in that grouping as well as a "transient epicenter" due to all the horse show travel in and out of that state.</span></p>
        <h2 style="background: white;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Clinical Signs of Lyme Disease</span></strong></h2>
        <p><span>A big challenge for both horse owners and veterinarians is that </span><a href="https://www.farnam.com/stable-talk/tick-borne-diseases-on-the-rise-learn-how-to-protect-your-horse">tick-borne disease</a><span> can present with nonspecific clinical signs, so veterinarians have to consider numerous possibilities before arriving at a specific diagnosis.</span></p>
        <p><span>Lyme disease isn't usually even suspected unless the horse lives in, or has traveled to, an area known to have ticks infected with</span><em> B. burgdorferi</em><span> and ticks have been found on the horse.</span></p>
        <p><span>The veterinarian will look for clinical signs while at the same time rule out other causes of those clinical signs. If you think diagnosing Lyme disease sounds like a major investigative process, you're right.</span></p>
        <p><span>Adding to the difficulty of diagnosis is the fact that Lyme disease in horses has only three&nbsp;definitively&nbsp;proven clinical presentations:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="color: black; background: white;"><span>Pseudolymphoma around a tick bite site (appearance similar to&nbsp;</span><span>nodular skin</span><span>&nbsp;cancer)</span></li>
            <li style="color: black; background: white;"><span>Anterior Uveitis (inflammation within the eye similar to "moon blindness")</span></li>
            <li style="color: black; background: white; margin-bottom: 2.5pt;"><span>Neurological disease (especially if the horse also has&nbsp;</span><span>uveitis),&nbsp;known as neuroborreliosis</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">Swinebroad notes that beyond these proven clinical signs of Lyme disease, other indications that have been&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">reported</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;in&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">suspected</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;cases include&nbsp;stiffness,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">shifting-leg</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;lameness, shuffling gaits, muscle soreness, lethargy, behavioral changes and skin sensitivity that makes it&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">irritable</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;to the touch (hyperesthesia).</span></p>
        <h2 style="background: white;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Diagnosing Lyme Disease</span></strong></h2>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span>Part of the ongoing challenge with Lyme disease is that horses can be exposed to the bacteria, and even infected by it, but not actually show any of the clinical signs. And there is a definite difference between being exposed, infected and diseased. Look at it this way:</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">If someone who has an influenza virus sneezes on you, you're&nbsp;<strong>exposed</strong>,&nbsp;but you're only&nbsp;<strong>infected</strong>&nbsp;if you breathe in the virus particles. Even if you're infected, you only become&nbsp;<strong>diseased</strong>&nbsp;if your body doesn't mount an effective immune response&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">fight off the virus&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">and you show clinical signs of influenza</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">Swinebroad says that this is very similar to how it is with horses and Lyme disease. A horse could be&nbsp;<strong>exposed</strong>&nbsp;if a tick infected with&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>&nbsp;attaches to him, but the horse is only&nbsp;<strong>infected</strong>&nbsp;if the bacteria gets into his&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">system</span><span style="color: black;">. Even then, the horse is only considered&nbsp;<strong>diseased</strong>&nbsp;if he develops clinical symptoms after being exposed and infected.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">A veterinarian will draw blood and have it tested for&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi&nbsp;</em></span><span style="color: black;">serum</span><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;antibodies. Yet even if testing shows&nbsp;positive&nbsp;levels of these antibodies, this doesn't 100% mean the horse has Lyme disease.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">Positive serology simply indicates past or present infection (or in some cases, vaccination). </span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;There is no test for Lyme disease (just exposure and infection), nor does a positive result predict whether infection will cause clinical signs in the future,&rdquo; says Swinebroad. &ldquo;Once in the positive range, the patient with the higher antibody titer doesn't mean the horse is sicker than one with a lower titer." The ACVIM consensus paper clearly states: &ldquo;There is no known correlation between magnitude of titer and likelihood of disease.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">Interestingly, the only definitive way to prove the presence of Lyme disease is upon necropsy.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span><br />
        </span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span>Swinebroad explains that to make a Lyme diagnosis, the horse must have&nbsp;clinical signs associated with Lyme disease,&nbsp;</span><span>which are&nbsp;</span><span>supported by serological testing. As he says, "If you have a horse with clinical signs and a positive titer, and you've ruled everything else out, then you&nbsp;</span><span>have an evidence-based rationale to</span><span>&nbsp;treat the horse for Lyme."</span></p>
        <h2><strong><span>Treatment </span></strong></h2>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span>Antibiotic treatment is the typical approach if a horse has&nbsp;</span><span>increased<strong></strong></span><span>antibody levels and&nbsp;</span><span>compatible</span><span>&nbsp;clinical signs and if the veterinarian has ruled out other diseases. The tetracycline class of antibiotics is the most commonly used for treating Lyme, and treatment usually continues for at least four weeks.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">Swinebroad adds that in some cases, horses being treated for Lyme disease may also need&nbsp;anti-rheumatoid&nbsp;arthritis/anti-inflammatory medications. Your veterinarian would determine the best course of treatment for your horse.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 2.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">"Although antibiotics are generally effective at all stages of the disease,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">clinical signs&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">may persist in some patients&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">an extended period of time&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">despite oral and intravenous antibiotic treatment," notes Swinebroad.</span></p>
        <h2><strong><span>Preventing Lyme Disease</span></strong></h2>
        <p><span>Since ticks are to blame for transmitting the disease, <a href="https://www.farnam.com/stable-talk/protect-yourself-and-your-horse-from-insect-borne-disease">guarding against them</a> is the best preventive measure.</span></p>
        <p><span>Woods, tall grass, shady areas and layers of vegetation are where ticks hang out when they aren't attached to a host. With that in mind:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span>Fence off wooded sections of the pasture</span></li>
            <li><span>Keep pastures mowed so that grass isn't excessively tall</span></li>
            <li><span>Clear areas of brush/weeds in turn-out areas</span></li>
            <li><span>Maintain a mowed strip of several feet between woods and horse areas</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>In addition, choose an <a href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/fly-insect-control/dual-defense">on-horse repellent product</a> that specifically addresses ticks. <a href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/fly-insect-control/equi-spot">Spot-on topical products</a> are ideal for pastured horses that aren't groomed routinely and checked for ticks daily.</span></p>
        <p><span>Make checking for ticks a regular part of your grooming routine &mdash; </span><span>whether you ride</span><span> or not. Ticks can attach anywhere but tend to prefer areas with thin skin, so pay close attention to your horse's legs, neck, flank area, and all along the base of the mane, as well as the tail head.</span></p>
        <p><span>It is generally accepted that an infected tick must be attached for&nbsp;</span><span>a variable period of time to&nbsp;</span><span>transmit the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, which is why daily checks are important.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span>Some </span><span>research has shown that Lyme disease transmission is greatest when ticks are in the nymphal stage, typically around May and June. Unfortunately, nymphs are tiny &mdash; about the size of a pinhead or poppy seed &mdash; making them much harder to find on the horse's body.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span>But don't make the mistake of thinking ticks are active only during warm weather. Ticks are adaptive and some are active even during cold weather, so using </span><a href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/fly-insect-control/dual-defense">protection on your horse and yourself</a><span>, and doing tick checks should be a year-round habit.</span></p>
        <p><span>At this time there are no vaccines labeled for horses with tick-borne diseases, although there is one for dogs.</span></p>
        <p><span>"Guarding against ticks is best; there&nbsp;isn't</span><span>&nbsp;an effective prophylactic </span><span>protection," says Swinebroad. He points out that in endemic regions, some equine veterinarians are using canine Lyme vaccine</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;on horses, injecting&nbsp;</span><span>them</span><span>&nbsp;multiple times a year.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>If you live in an area where Lyme disease is an issue, it's worth asking your veterinarian if the canine vaccine could be a reasonable</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>approach for your horse.</span></p>
        <h2><strong><span>Removing Ticks</span></strong></h2>
        <p><span>Should you find a tick on your horse (or yourself), remove it with a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or forceps, not your fingers. Holding the tweezers as close to the skin as possible, grasp the tick by its mouthparts. Pull back with steady, even pressure. Don&rsquo;t twist or jerk, and don&rsquo;t squeeze the tick&rsquo;s body, as this can release infectious organisms. Once removed, drown the tick in a dish of soapy water or just flush it. Wash your hands well with soap and water.</span></p>
        <p><span>Even if a tick doesn&rsquo;t transmit a disease, it can still cause inflammation, swelling and itching. The small wound left after removing a tick can be contaminated by flies feeding on it, which can lead to secondary bacterial infection. Clean the area with alcohol or an antiseptic formulated for equine use and apply antibiotic ointment or <a href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/wound-care">wound care product</a> to aid healing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><span>Did You Know?</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong><span>Ticks aren't just a warm weather concern. Some species <span class="addresswsitem">can even survive in winter, comfortably insulated in the vegetation beneath a blanket of snow. This is why year-round tick checks should be part of your grooming routine and your own personal hygiene routine anytime you've been riding or walking in any wooded area.</span></span></p>
        <p><span class="addresswsitem"><strong><span>Did You Know?</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span class="addresswsitem"><strong></strong></span><span class="addresswsitem">Since ticks are essentially blind, they locate their hosts by detecting exhaled carbon dioxide and ammonia, as well as sensing vibrations, moisture and body heat. </span><span style="background: #fefefe; color: #0a0a0a;">Ticks can't jump, but they have perfected a technique known as "questing," in which they hold onto grasses, leaves or branches while reaching out with their front pair of legs. When a horse &mdash; or other host &mdash; walks by, the tick grabs on and then finds a place on the animal's body to attach for a blood meal.</span></p>
