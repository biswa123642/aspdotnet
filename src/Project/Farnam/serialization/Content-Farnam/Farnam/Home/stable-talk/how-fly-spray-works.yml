        <p>You may be one of those horse owners who stays faithful to a
        product for years. Or you may be in the camp that likes to
        experiment with different products.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain, the shelves&mdash;both online and at your
        local retailer&mdash;are brimming with a variety of fly repellent products.</p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t need a science degree to have a basic understanding
        of how fly sprays work. In just a few minutes, you can learn the
        how and why behind choosing products that work best for your
        horse.
        </p>
        <h2>
        How they work</h2>
        <p>You might think the goal of any fly spray is just to keep flies
        away, but it&rsquo;s not that simple.
        </p>
        <p>The active ingredients&mdash;both natural and synthetic&mdash;in fly
        sprays have different properties and don&rsquo;t work the same way.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;The active ingredients and chemicals may result in different
        types of repellency,&rdquo; says Casey White, entomologist and Senior
        Director of Technical Services and Innovation at Farnam's Research
        and Development facility in Dallas.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a horse owner who doesn&rsquo;t want to see flies land on
        or stay on your animal, look for a product that says &lsquo;repels and
        kills,&rsquo;&rdquo; advises White, noting that most fly control products in the
        Farnam portfolio will kill and repel.
        </p>
        <p>If the label says &ldquo;kills and repels,&rdquo; this means that whether the
        insect is contacted by the product during application or comes in
        contact with it on the animal, the pest will be driven away and die.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Tactile repellency</h2>
        <p>Entomologists often refer to tactile repellency as &ldquo;hot foot&rdquo;
        repellency. That&rsquo;s because when insects land on a horse sprayed
        with a product containing these active ingredients, they experience
        an irritating sensation, and quickly identify that&rsquo;s not a good place
        to be.
        </p>
        <p>Just by landing on the sprayed animal, the pests will likely leave
        and then die because they&rsquo;ve come in contact with those active
        ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>Among active ingredients that offer tactile repellency are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cypermethrin</li>
            <li>Permethrin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&ldquo;You may see flies on the horse for a brief period, but they&rsquo;ll be
        repelled to move away from the treated horse and likely go away
        and die,&rdquo; says White.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Spatial repellency </h2>
        <p>Ingredients with spatial repellency discourage flies from landing
        in the first place.</p>
        <p>They create somewhat of an invisible barrier around the
        sprayed horse, causing blood-feeding pests like mosquitoes, midges
        and certain flies to look for other places to obtain a blood meal.</p>
        <p>Among active ingredients that offer spatial repellency are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Citronella</li>
            <li>Other plant-based essential oils</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&ldquo;Most horse owners using a spray as a repellent value the fact
        that the product drives pests away, instead of letting them land and
        feed on or annoy the horse,&rdquo; says White.
        </p>

        <h2>
        Closer look at ingredients</h2>
        <p>Product labels don&rsquo;t distinguish between spatial and tactile
        repellency characteristics, but now you know there&rsquo;s a difference
        between active ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>By law, every fly spray label must list the product's active
        ingredients, which are registered with the Environmental Protection
        Agency (EPA).
        </p>
        <p>Active ingredients are those ingredients with insecticide
        (killing) and repellent properties.
        </p>
        <p>Active ingredients can be both natural and synthetic. Because
        synthetic active ingredients last longer than natural active
        ingredients, the most effective fly repellent products often contain a
        combination of both natural and synthetic active ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most common active natural ingredients are
        pyrethrins, which are derived from a species of chrysanthemum.
        </p>
        <p>Pyrethroids are synthetic forms of pyrethrins. Some common
        pyrethroids are permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin,
        tetramethrin, and resmethrin.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Inactive&rdquo; ingredients serve as the base of any fly spray and
        these ingredients aren&rsquo;t required to be listed individually.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Natural angle
        </h2>
        <p>But wait, isn&rsquo;t citronella a natural ingredient?
        </p>
        <p>That it is. In fact, citronella is just one common ingredient
        found in repellents that use natural ingredients instead of
        chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>Natural ingredients typically include essential oils such as
        citronella, geraniol, eucalyptus, thyme, cedar oil, lemongrass,
        rosemary oil and others.
        </p>
        <p>Just realize that natural repellent sprays don't contain
        insecticides, meaning they are better used to repel insects vs. kill
        them.
        </p>
        <h2>Water-based vs oil-based</h2>
        <p>Fly sprays are either made with a water or oil base, depending
        on the ingredients used. If you see "petroleum distillates&rdquo; listed
        among active ingredients, it's oil-based.
        </p>
        <p>Oil-based products adhere to the hair coat quickly and provide
        fast pest knockdown. However, if you&rsquo;re trying to keep your horse&rsquo;s
        coat spotless, just know that these products are more likely to
        attract dust and dirt.
        </p>
        <p>Water-based products tend to be less irritating to skin and
        don&rsquo;t attract dirt and dust, but White points out that water-based
        repellent products break down more easily.
        </p>
        <p>To help water-based repellents last longer and stay effective,
        the formulation typically includes chemical agents known as
        synergists, which you&rsquo;ll see on the ingredients list as Piperonyl
        Butoxide (PBO), Butoxypolypropylene Glycol, and N-Octyl
        Bicycloheptene Dicarboximide (MGK 264). Try saying those fast
        three times!
        </p>
        <p>White explains that when a product has claims like &ldquo;weatherproof&rdquo; and &ldquo;won&rsquo;t sweat off,&rdquo; this is due to both the combination of
        active ingredients and the formulation.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that bathing isn&rsquo;t the same as the horse being
        rained on or getting sweaty. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Any time you are bathing a horse, it&rsquo;s going to diminish the
        effectiveness of the product. Even if a product has weather-resistant
        or sweat-resistant claims, you&rsquo;re likely going to remove the product
        if you use shampoo or high volume of water,&rdquo; says White.</p>
        <p>He recommends reapplying fly spray after bathing, but it&rsquo;s
        important to let the horse completely dry first.
        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="-/media/80063004EE7D45AAA2C9C7892BA1D90F.ashx" width="479" height="317" /></p>
        <h2>Read that label
        </h2>
        <p>Okay, so the label on your fly spray doesn&rsquo;t count as exciting
        reading, but those directions are key to how well a product works.
        Take a minute to actually read them.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re buying a product to protect your horse and expecting
        it to meet the claims on the label, you can&rsquo;t expect it to perform
        unless you use it according to label directions,&rdquo; says White.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most common mistakes horse owners make is not
        applying fly repellents according to directions.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Many people will just spray their horse a dozen times and
        think they&rsquo;ve done it justice. This may kill any flies that are actually
        sprayed, but to get the residual rate that&rsquo;s stated on the label, you
        have to apply according to the label,&rdquo; he notes.</p>
        <p>White explains that a huge amount of research goes into
        dosage and application rate to ensure that label claims are met.
        Following label directions is important for both safety and to ensure
        the product works as stated.
        </p>
        <h2>Application rate
        </h2>
        <p>In case you wondered, application rates can vary significantly.</p>
        <p>For example, some product directions specify applying 1 ounce
        per 100 pounds. For an average 1,000-pound horse, that translates
        to over 1 cup of spray per application. Other products specify
        applying 1 ounce to the entire horse.
        </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s easy to see how just a few quick spritzes across the horse
        with either product isn&rsquo;t going to apply enough to work according to
        label directions.
        </p>
        <p>A straightforward way to know you&rsquo;re applying the right
        amount is to do a little research of your own when using a new
        product. Count the number of sprays as you spray the product into
        a measuring cup to the amount stated on the label for protection
        and efficacy. </p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t have to measure again, just spray that approximate
        number of times when applying the product to your horse.
        </p>
        <h2>Using multiple products
        </h2>
        <p>There are times you may want to use more than one product. </p>
        <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you rely on a spot-on for on-going
        protection for your pastured horse.
        </p>
        <p>A spot-on is applied to strategic locations on the animal
        according to label directions. Thanks to the oil-based carrier, after
        application the product disperses across the animal&rsquo;s body to
        provide protection and full coverage over time.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The spot-on product works well on horses that are turned out
        on pasture and not being ridden frequently,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;If you go
        out to ride on the weekend, you might want to spray with a
        repellent product before riding, depending on insect activity.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Natural repellents tend to smell good and are very effective for
        a short duration. This can make them an ideal choice specifically
        while riding.</p>
        <p>Congrats! You just became a mini expert in the science of fly
        repellents. In addition to making smart choices the next time you
        shop, you&rsquo;ll never look at a fly spray label the same way again.</p>
