        <p rs_id="871"><span rs_id="872" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></p> Sometimes a simple change makes a huge improvement.<br> <br> In the case of Farnam's popular Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray and Tri-Tec 14 Fly Repellent, that simple change came about after listening to horse owners. They loved the product and appreciated the money-saving option of using gallon bottles to fill their quart sprayers, but.... <p rs_id="873"><span rs_id="874" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></p> <br rs_id="875">They didn't like the mess and hassle of filling those sprayers. The process invariably meant spilling valuable repellent and getting horse owners' hands dirty.<br rs_id="811"> <br rs_id="812"> "We listen to our customers and we understood their frustration with filling quart sprayers," says Tina Anderson, director of new products strategy and development for Farnam.<br rs_id="813"> <br rs_id="814"> Anderson is a horse owner herself and was personally familiar with the frustration of trying to fill sprayers without making a mess. Sure, you could use a funnel to fill those quart bottles, but that meant keeping a funnel handy, adding one more step to the process.<br rs_id="815"> <br rs_id="816"> "We looked hard at other industries and bottles in the soap market prompted the change," she explains. "We wanted to find a package that was not only easier to handle, lift and pour, but that also reduced the amount of product wasted by spilling on the barn floor.&nbsp;<ul rs_id="817"> </ul>We kept in mind that many of our customers are women, and sometimes the current-style gallon container can be a little heavy and awkward to pour when the handle is on the top."<br rs_id="868"> <span style="background-color: inherit;" rs_id="869"><br rs_id="870">Enter Farnam's new easy pour bottles.&nbsp;</span><br rs_id="871"> <p rs_id="872"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="873">The whole idea was to simplify the fly control routine and make it less messy for horse owners. Utilizing a spill-proof spout and moving the handle made the easy pour bottles much easier to use. Farnam also increased the convenience factor by adding a new smaller size, the 50-ounce bottle.&nbsp;</span></p> <p rs_id="874">"The easy pour style is really female-friendly and greatly reduces the amount of spill and waste of product. You can fill your spray bottles one-handed now," says Anderson. "The new 50-ounce bottle is easier for travel because of the lighter weight. It takes up less room in the tack box or the tack compartment of your trailer when you take it along to shows, trail rides, or wherever you might be traveling with your horses."&nbsp;</p> <p class="callout" rs_id="879"><span rs_id="880">The whole idea was to simplify the fly control routine and make it less messy for horse owners.</span></p> <p rs_id="876"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="877">Farnam is currently the only company in the equine market offering this style of bottles for their fly repellent. Even though the bottle redesign required making changes to production machinery to accommodate the new bottles, Farnam decided against raising the price of either Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray or Tri-Tec 14 Fly Repellent.&nbsp;</span></p> <p rs_id="878">"We wanted the consumer to get an upgraded, user-friendly design at the same price point as our old-style bottles," says Anderson. "There's no price increase on our end."</p>The easy pour bottles began hitting the shelves in the spring of 2017, just in time for fly season, and Anderson says Farnam is already receiving great feedback from customers.&nbsp;<p rs_id="881"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="882">As of now, Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray and Tri-Tec 14 Fly Repellent are the only Farnam products offered in the easy pour packaging with 50-ounce and 128-ounce options, but Anderson says horse owners should "stay tuned" to see more of the company's insect repellent products moving in this direction.&nbsp; </span></p> <p rs_id="883"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="884">That only makes sense, as consumers do gravitate toward larger bottles in an effort to save money. On average the horse owner saves about 20% when use the larger size bottles instead of continually buying quart-size sprayers simply because they are easy to handle.&nbsp; </span></p> <p rs_id="885"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="886">Farnam was determined to give horse owners more reasons to love their favorite fly protection. With the advent of their new easy pour bottles, they've done just that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p rs_id="887"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="888">Endure and Tri-Tec 14 are trademarks of Farnam Companies, Inc.</span></p>
