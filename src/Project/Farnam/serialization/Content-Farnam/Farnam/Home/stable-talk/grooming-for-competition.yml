        You've circled the date on your calendar. There's a show coming up, or maybe it's the annual trail ride with your saddle club. Either way, you want to arrive with your horse looking his absolute best.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Conscientious owners know you can&rsquo;t wait until right before an event to focus on appearance. With balanced nutrition and regular grooming, your horse&rsquo;s coat should stay in good condition year-round. Then you can fine-tune the details of hooves, mane and tail in the two weeks before an event.&nbsp;<br />
        For &ldquo;in the trenches&rdquo; advice, we checked in with Alyssa Barngrover and Julie Hoefling, marketing managers with Farnam, who have extensive show experience.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;You need to keep your horse well-groomed all the time because there&rsquo;s only so much you can do last minute to make a difference. You may up your game a little right before a big horse show, but there&rsquo;s no mad rush because everything you do on a daily basis is prepping for this,&rdquo; says Julie, who shows her quarter horse gelding at the national level in AQHA All-Around Western events.<br />
        If you already have an effective <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.farnam.com/stable-talk/grooming-more-than-just-a-pre-ride-ritual" target="_blank">grooming routine</a>, it&rsquo;s time to focus on the pre-show details.
        <h2>
        Time that shoeing</h2>
        &nbsp;
        Whether you&rsquo;re going out of state or competing locally, the ideal time frame for shoeing is one to two weeks before a show.<br />
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want your horse done the week of the show just because there&rsquo;s always the potential for a &lsquo;hot&rsquo; nail or sensitivity. Two weeks out should have your horse&rsquo;s feet in perfect condition,&rdquo; says Alyssa, who competes in dressage both regionally and nationally with her Hanoverian mare.<br />
        &ldquo;Work with your farrier to find the best time and plan your shoeing so your horse is not getting shod right before a show, so you don&rsquo;t risk tenderness,&rdquo; says Julie. &ldquo;I do it about a week out, but it also depends on how long your show is.&rdquo;&nbsp;
        <h2>
        Come clean</h2>
        <span> </span>Even though you don&rsquo;t want to use shampoo more often than once a week to preserve the hair&rsquo;s natural oils, hose off your horse if he&rsquo;s sweaty after riding.
        &ldquo;If you leave sweat to dry, it makes the coat look dingy and dull,&rdquo; says Alyssa. &ldquo;It also makes horses itchy, so it&rsquo;s important to get the sweat off to keep the coat shiny and healthy.&rdquo;
        The week before a show &ndash; and at the event &ndash; a color-enhancing shampoo like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/grooming-care/vetrolin-white-n-brite" target="_blank">Vetrolin&reg; White 'N Brite</a> is ideal. This is especially helpful if, like Alyssa, you have a gray horse or one with lots of chrome. Both Alyssa and Julie rely on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/grooming-care/vetrolin-green-spot-out" target="_blank">Vetrolin&reg; Green Spot Out</a> as a dry shampoo for more than just manure spots.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for spot cleaning when you don&rsquo;t need a full-blown bath,&rdquo; says Julie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also really good for white markings and faces; you can spray it on a rag, rub it on the white and it cleans right up.&rdquo;
        <h2>
        Clipping</h2>
        <p>
        For a polished turnout, do your clipping close to the event.<br />
        &ldquo;We clip muzzles, ears, bridlepaths and fetlocks a day or two before the show,&rdquo; says Julie. &ldquo;Clip when your horse is clean. Otherwise it will dirty and dull your blades faster.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
        Follow the basic guidelines for bridlepath length in your breed and discipline.<br />
        To tidy up the ears, Alyssa recommends holding each ear in your hand and gently folding it &ldquo;taco style.&rdquo; Then trim the edges and any hair sticking out. Leaving hair inside the ear offers protection from insects.<br />
        Alyssa notes that dressage competitors don&rsquo;t shave any whiskers, so she skips the muzzle when clipping.<br />
        Finish the head by trimming any long throatlatch hairs.<br />
        For a sleek appearance, clip any overgrown hairs along the backs of the legs, fetlocks and around the hooves.<br />
        Julie recommends taking a hand razor to the event for touch-ups, especially if you have a long show. This way your horse stays looking freshly trimmed.</p>
        <h2>
        Tame the tail</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;<br />
        <span> </span>Artificial tails are commonly used in All-Around Western events but not in cow and ranch events. The horse&rsquo;s natural tail should be in the best shape possible before attaching an artificial tail.<br />
        <span> </span>In between shows, the horse&rsquo;s tail is typically braided and kept in a tail bag to protect it. Julie explains that the tail is left down after shampooing close to a show.&nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;We want the hair to be straight. You don&rsquo;t want any kinks from the braid or tail bag,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;<br />
        Tail bags are not standard in dressage barns, but a flowing, tangle-free tail is desirable in both Western and English disciplines. To keep their horses&rsquo; tails smooth and manageable, Julie and Alyssa routinely use <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.farnam.com/all-products/grooming-care/laser-sheen-dazzling-shine-and-detangler" target="_blank">Laser Sheen&reg; Dazzling Shine &amp; Detangler</a> as a regular part of year-round tail care.<br />
        This shine spray is an indispensable tool for every grooming session to keep coats shiny and conditioned.<br />
        &ldquo;In addition to removing any last bits of dirt and dust, it also helps prevent stains,&rdquo; says Alyssa, who finds a shine spray excellent for banishing static after vacuuming the coat to eliminate dust and dander.</p>
        <h2>
        Tidy up manes</h2>
        <p>
        <span> </span>Many riders competing in Western disciplines &ldquo;band&rdquo; their horses&rsquo; manes. The mane should be pulled and thinned as needed for a polished look, but not right before a show.&nbsp;<br />
        <span> </span>&ldquo;Pull or thin the mane one to two weeks out so it settles and lays flat; then you&rsquo;ll only need to do finishing touches right before the show,&rdquo; says Julie.<br />
        <span> </span> To simplify the task, pull the mane before bathing when the hair is dry, not wet. This ensures you get the right length and it&rsquo;s easier to pull when hair is not totally clean.<br />
        Dressage riders usually keep their horses&rsquo; manes about four to six inches long for ease of braiding, and often use dressage buttons, not plaits.<br />
        &ldquo;If you keep it about this length, it only requires a quick tidy-up before a show. If you need to shorten the mane to a good braiding length, do this two to three weeks out,&rdquo; says Alyssa.&nbsp;<br />
        She adds that braiding the mane is easier if it's not shampooed right before. A clean mane is a slippery mane and is therefore harder to braid.</p>
        <h3>
        Don&rsquo;t forget...</h3>
        <p>
        Keep in mind that any preventive health care and necessary paperwork &ndash; vaccinations, Coggins, health certificate &ndash; should be scheduled in advance so you&rsquo;re not scrambling close to showtime.&nbsp;<br />
        And to avoid potential side effects, such as stiff or sore muscles, don&rsquo;t vaccinate your horse just before an event. You don't want him to feeling &ldquo;off&rdquo; or cranky when you've done everything in your power to help him put his best foot forward.&nbsp;</p>
