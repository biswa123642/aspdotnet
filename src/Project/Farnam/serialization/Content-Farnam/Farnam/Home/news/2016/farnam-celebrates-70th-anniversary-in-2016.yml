        <p>Founded in 1946, Phoenix-based Farnam Companies, Inc. grew from a small mail-order business to become one of the largest marketers of equine products in the United States. Serving all facets of the equine industry--from hobby barns to large professional operations--Farnam is one of the most widely recognized names in the equine animal health care industry.</p>
        <p> In addition to distributors and mass merchants across the U.S., Farnam products are also sold in Canada, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, Europe, and the Middle and Far East.</p>
        <p> As the leader in quality horse care products, Farnam offers an ever-expanding range of equine essentials, including fly control, dewormer, grooming, hoof and leg care, wound care treatments, leather care, stable supplies and nutritional supplements. Extensive research and attention to detail go into every product that carries the familiar Farnam logo.</p>
        <p>To mark this milestone 70th anniversary, Farnam will be offering special celebration offers throughout the year on their Facebook page, their free Life With Horses newsletter, and at equine events across the country. </p>
        <p>The mission of Farnam is to improve the lives of horses, from head to hoof, inside and out. To that end, the company continually strives to create innovative products that support the horse&rsquo;s overall health and comfort in both the pleasure and performance horse markets. No one knows horses better than Farnam. That&rsquo;s why no one offers a more complete selection of horse care products. No one.</p>
