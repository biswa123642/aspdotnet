        <p rs_id="816"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="817">Just in time for the 2017 fly season, Farnam introduces new easy pour bottles for </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="818">Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray and Tri-Tec 14<sup rs_id="819"> </sup>Fly Repellent. Both product lines now feature a spill-proof spout and the handle is on the side of the bottle rather than the top. For even more convenience, Farnam added a new smaller size, the 50-ounce bottle, which is lighter and takes up less space, making it easier to use and ideal for travel.</span></span></p>
        <p rs_id="820"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="821">"We listen to our customers and we understood their frustration with filling quart sprayers," says Tina Anderson, </span><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="822">Director of New Products Strategy and Development for Farnam. "We kept in mind that many of our customers are women, so we wanted a package that was not only easier to handle, lift and pour, but that also reduced the amount of product wasted by spilling on the barn floor. We looked hard at other industries and bottles in the soap market prompted the change."</span></span></p>
        <p rs_id="823"><span style="font-weight: lighter; font-family: arial;" rs_id="824">Although the redesign required making changes to production machinery to accommodate the new bottles, Farnam did not increase the price on these upgraded, user-friendly bottles. Farnam is currently the only company in the equine market offering this style of bottles for their fly repellent.</span></p>
        <p rs_id="825"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="826">Customers tend to gravitate toward larger bottles because this means an average savings of about 20% over continually buying quart-size sprayers. Anderson says that in the future more of the company's insect repellent products will likely adopt the easy pour packaging with 50-ounce and 128-ounce options that are now only available in Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray and Tri-Tec 14</span><sup style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="827"> </sup><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="828">Fly Repellent.</span></span></p>
