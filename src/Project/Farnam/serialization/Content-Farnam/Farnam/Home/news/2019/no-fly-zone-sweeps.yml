        <p>If you're looking forward to warm weather riding, but dreading fly season, it's time for a different approach.</p>
        <p>Farnam wants to change your view of fly season permanently, starting with the "No Fly Zone" Sweepstakes. No purchase is necessary to enter. Just visit the Farnam website at <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1AD1ADD786334B74887E87AE80A1E243&amp;_z=z">www.farnam.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Ten lucky horse owners will win "No Fly Zone" kits containing a variety of tried-and-true Farnam favorites, as well as the newest innovations in fly control. Each kit is valued at $500. Plus, everyone who enters gets a $2 instant coupon good on any Farnam fly control product, which can be used at your local equine supply store.</p>
        <p>Smart horse owners know it takes more than just a good fly spray to win the pest control battle. For superior protection against flies, gnats, mosquitoes and ticks, you need a multi-zone program that blocks, repels and reduces.</p>
        <p>A physical barrier, such as a fly mask, blocks flies and insects, while sprays, wipe-ons, rolls-ons and spot-ons repel flies and pests. Using a feed-through product breaks the fly life cycle and actually reduces the fly population.</p>
        <p>The "No Fly Zone" Sweepstakes ends May 31, 2019 so enter today for your chance to win. For complete rules and to enter, just go to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://news.farnam.com/noflyzonesweeps">https://news.farnam.com/noflyzonesweeps</a>.</p>
