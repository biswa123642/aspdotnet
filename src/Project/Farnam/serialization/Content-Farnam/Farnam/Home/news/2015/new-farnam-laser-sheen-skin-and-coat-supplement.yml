        <p>Head-turning shine does more than make a great first impression. It also speaks volumes about a horse&rsquo;s overall well-being. When your horse needs to look and feel his best, you need new Laser Sheen Skin &amp; Coat Supplement. This scientifically formulated blend provides essential nutrients for a radiant coat and healthy skin from the inside out.</p>
        <p>Formulated by an equine PhD nutritionist, the new Farnam Laser Sheen Skin &amp; Coat Supplement provides a show-stopping shine that will capture the attention of any audience. In addition to a dazzling, shiny coat, it delivers healthy, supple skin and helps strengthen mane and tail.</p>
        <p>Laser Sheen Skin &amp; Coat Supplement contains ceramides &mdash; the same fatty acids found in many beauty products for humans &mdash; to help retain moisture for a velvety soft coat as well as help support skin hydration. A proper balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids supports skin and coat health. It also contains a probiotic to support proper digestion of nutrients, allowing your horse to get the most benefit from each ingredient.</p>
        <p>There&rsquo;s less waste because the unique extruded nuggets are readily eaten. Feed it year-round and watch your horse bloom. Laser Sheen Skin &amp; Coat Supplement is available in two convenient packaging options: a 7.5 lb. Farnam Fresh Keeper Bucket and a handy 30-day, 3.75 lb. bag that can be used as a refill. </p>
        <p> Recommended by veterinarians, Laser Sheen Skin &amp; Coat Supplement is designed to support beauty from the inside out, while Laser Sheen Show Stopping Shampoo and Laser Sheen Dazzling Shine &amp; Detangler promote beauty from the outside in. Together, the combination provides healthy skin, coat, mane and tail.</p>
