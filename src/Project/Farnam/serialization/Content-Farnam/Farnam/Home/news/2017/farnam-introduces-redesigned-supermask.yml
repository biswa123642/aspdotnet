There's also the option of soft, mesh ears for additional protection. The redesigned SuperMask horse fly mask offers all that--and more.</span></span></p>
        <p rs_id="857"><span rs_id="858" style="font-family: arial;">"Our improved SuperMask is longer on the nose and covers up to 20 percent more of the horse's face," explains Jeanne Parker, an engineer and seamstress who worked on the redesign as manager of manufacturing technology for Farnam.</span></p>
        <p rs_id="859"><span rs_id="860" style="font-family: arial;">"The overall fit is now better for the horse. The improved SuperMask fits better around the ears; it fits closer to the head with less gap around the ear area," says Parker. "People with Arabs will especially appreciate the redesign, because those finer heads have been harder to fit with many masks."</span></p>
        <p rs_id="861"><span rs_id="862" style="font-family: arial;">The unique horse-proof Double-Latch Closure gives SuperMask horse fly mask twice the "stay-on power" of other masks. The redesign added an elastic band to the closure, allowing for more customized fitting. There's even a place to personalize the mask and write your horse's name on the tag to avoid mix-ups in stables with multiple horses. Another improvement included tucking under and sewing the trim edges so there's no unfinished edge.</span></p>
