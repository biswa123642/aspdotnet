        Recognition from your peers is the greatest compliment. At the just-concluded American Horse Publications 2016 Conference, &ldquo;May the Horse Be with You,&rdquo; held in Orlando, Florida, Farnam Companies, Inc. was honored with six awards in multiple equine media categories.<br />
        The annual contest has been held since 1974 and is open to members of American Horse Publications (AHP), a professional association that promotes excellence in equine media and improved communication and understanding within the world of equine publishing.<br />
        <br />
        These awards honor excellence in equine media and encompass both the publishing media division and the business division. This year&rsquo;s competition included 770 total entries from 98 members. Entries were reviewed and critiqued by 28 professional judges.<br />
        <br />
        At the Equine Media Awards presentation on June 18, Farnam received four first-place awards, one second and one third.<br />
        <br />
        Out of 22 entries in the Business Equine-Related Single Print Advertisement category, Farnam took home first-place honors with&nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;Horseshoer&rsquo;s Secret &mdash; Built Strong from the Ground Up.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In the same highly competitive category, &ldquo;Strong Bonds Are Built with Great Care&rdquo; placed third.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The &ldquo;Horseshoer&rsquo;s Secret Campaign&rdquo; also captured first place in the Business Equine-Related Brand Multimedia Ad Campaign category.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In the category of Business Brand Equine-Related Blog, Farnam&rsquo;s&nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;Stable Talk&rdquo; won first place.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        First place out of nine entries in the Business Brand Equine-Related Custom Publication category went to Farnam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultimate Horse Care Guide 2015.&rsquo;<br />
        <br />
        In the category of Business Equine-Related eNewsletter, Farnam received second place with &ldquo;Life with Horses.&rsquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;It was truly an honor to be recognized at the national level in a group that included such high-caliber entries from so many different members,&rdquo; says Mark Chenoweth, General Manager, Farnam Companies, Inc. &ldquo;As this year marks Farnam&rsquo;s 70th anniversary, it is especially rewarding to receive this recognition. When 2016 began, we said we wanted to celebrate this special anniversary all year long, and I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to do it.&rdquo;<br />
