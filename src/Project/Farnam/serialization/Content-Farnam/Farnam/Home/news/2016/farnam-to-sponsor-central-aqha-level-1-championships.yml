        <p>About the Farnam AQHA Central Level 1 Championships</p>
        <p>The Farnam Central AQHA Level 1 Championships will offer AQHA&rsquo;s core and over-fences classes and will be the only Level 1 Championships to offer cattle classes. View the show-by-show class list here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aqha.com/shows/level-1/classes/" target="_blank">aqha.com/shows/level-1/classes/</a>.</p>
        <p>For 2016 only, AQHA has changed the qualifying rules. To be eligible to enter the 2016 Level 1 Championships, an exhibitor must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be Level 1-eligible in the class they wish to enter as of January 1, 2015.</li>
            <li>Be an AQHA member at the time of entry and at the time of the 2016 Level 1 Championships.</li>
            <li>If a competitor graduated out of Level 1 in the 2015 show season, he or she is still invited to enter the event.</li>
            <li>If you won a Level 1 championship in 2015, you cannot show in the same class at future Level 1 Championships, including the 2016 Level 1 Championships. However, you can still show in the class at AQHA shows (excluding the Level 1 Championships) until you meet the point level. You can still show at the Level 1 Championships in any other class(es) for which you are still Level 1-eligible. Learn more about AQHA Rule SHW245.3 in the AQHA Official Handbook of Rules and Regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Level 1 eligibility is determined on a class-by-class basis. Exhibitors are encouraged to use the online level verification system at services3.aqha.com/leveling to determine if they are Level 1-eligible in a particular class. Once they have verified their eligibility, exhibitors may download the Farnam Central Level 1 entry form at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aqha.com/level1championships" target="_blank">www.aqha.com/level1championships</a>.</p>
        <p>B&amp;W Rookie classes will be offered for exhibitors and horses that are eligible for the Rookie level as of January 1, 2015, for the Farnam Central, AQHA West or Nutrena East Level 1 Championships. The horse you intend to bring for the class must also be Rookie eligible. Call AQHA Customer Service at 806-376-4811 or visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://services3.aqha.com/leveling/" target="_blank">services3.aqha.com/leveling</a> to verify your and your horses' Rookie eligibility, and access Rookie entry forms at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aqha.com/level1championships" target="_blank">www.aqha.com/level1championships</a>.</p>
        <p>Rookie and Level 1 are the two levels of AQHA competition designed for beginner to minimally accomplished competitors, respectively. The Level 1 Championships were designed to celebrate the accomplishments of these riders and their horses in an environment that provides education and fun competition.</p>
