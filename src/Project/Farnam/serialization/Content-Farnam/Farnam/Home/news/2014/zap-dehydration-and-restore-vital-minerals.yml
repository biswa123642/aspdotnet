        <p>Horse owners have relied on Apple Elite Powder Electrolyte since 1990. Now you can help protect your horse&rsquo;s health by giving those crucial electrolytes in a convenient paste formula, thanks to Farnam&rsquo;s new Apple Elite Paste Electrolyte.</p>
        <p> Electrolytes are minerals found naturally in the horse&rsquo;s body. They&rsquo;re vital for normal function, affecting everything from muscle contraction to heart and brain function. When hot weather and/or stress, such as travel or competition, cause dehydration and deplete those minerals, your horse needs help&mdash;and fast.</p>
        <p>A powdered electrolyte is designed to be given in water and/or feed, but the concentrated formula of Apple Elite Paste Electrolyte is perfect for on-the-go use, making this a must-have for every horse owner&rsquo;s travel kit. Ideal for trail, performance, working and senior horses, it&rsquo;s formulated for all classes and ages of horses. You can even be proactive and feed the paste up to 12 hours ahead of travel or exercise.</p>
        <p>The handy 60cc syringe contains just the right amount for the average adult horse that needs an immediate serving of electrolytes for speedy uptake. The easy-to-understand label lets you adjust the amount given according to exercise intensity and how much your horse is sweating. Ideally, the contents should be fed in 20cc increments so your horse doesn&rsquo;t drop any of the paste.</p>
        <p>Scientifically formulated by Farnam&rsquo;s own equine research and development team, Apple Elite Paste Electrolyte contains the same mineral salts as those lost when your horse sweats. Because the paste contains the most bioavailable mineral forms, it provides rapid replenishment of electrolytes lost due to heat, humidity, exercise and stress. Plus, it&rsquo;s low in dextrose. </p>
        <p>Apple Elite Paste Electrolyte encourages normal water consumption year round and helps your horse&rsquo;s body maintain the fluid levels necessary for healthy normal function. It&rsquo;s also ideal for those times when he needs a quick recovery from the effects of electrolyte depletion.  </p>
        <p>Apple Elite Paste Electrolyte is the perfect companion to Apple Elite Powder Electrolyte, making sure your horse is protected both at home and when you&rsquo;re on the go. </p>
