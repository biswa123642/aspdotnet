        <p><span>The EPA-registered</span> <span>active ingredient in Dual Defense Insect Repellent for Horse &amp; Rider is picaridin, which is known for its efficacy. In addition, picaridin is reportedly less irritating to sensitive skin than repellents containing DEET.</span></p>
        <p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt; font-weight: lighter; color: #231f20;">"Not only can this well-known active ingredient be used on the whole family, it also provides great repellency for horses at the same time. You can use it on your children, as well as your horses to protect them and you don't have to keep reapplying it," says Anderson.</span></p>
        <p><span>Any insect repellent is only as good as the application process and Farnam's new</span><span> EquiVeil 360&deg; continuous spray bottle provides efficient application at any angle, even upside down. It's perfect for hard-to-reach areas, including under the horse's belly and inside the back legs.
