        <p style="text-align: left;" rs_id="824"><span style="font-weight: lighter;" rs_id="825">Until now, getting complete fly repellent coverage has been a challenge. It's one thing to spray a horse's back and sides, but what about those trickier areas, like under the belly and between the back legs? Those spots need fly protection too, but applying product isn't always easy.</span></p>
        <p rs_id="826"><span rs_id="827">Farnam is pleased to announce </span><span rs_id="828">two updated delivery methods for two of the strongest-selling brands in the company's line of premium fly control.</span></p>

The same powerfully effective formulas horse owners have relied on for years are now offered in an incredibly practical format.</p>
        <p rs_id="832"><span rs_id="833">Farnam's 360-degree continuous spray cans provide consistent, even application for </span><span rs_id="834">quiet, uniform protection. Because the can sprays at any angle--even upside down--there are no more hard-to-reach places. Just spray and the horse is protected. It's one more reason for horse owners to love their favorite fly repellent.</span></p>
        <p rs_id="835"><span rs_id="836">Unlike standard aerosol cans, with the new continuous spray can there is no propellant expelled with the product. And instead of the cold spray you get from an aerosol, the product comes out at room temperature, which is much more comfortable for the horse. The updated format also means the can empties completely, so no more wasted repellent, and the size makes for a container that's convenient to hold for effortless use.</span></p>
        <p rs_id="837"><span rs_id="838">Farnam is all about making their products easier for customers to use, while always providing the most effective fly protection.
