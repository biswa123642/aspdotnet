        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">When Stephenie </span><span style="color: #222222;">Bjorkman </span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">decided to enter her horse's photo in </span><span style="color: black;">Farnam's 2019 SuperMask SuperModel contest</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">, she had no idea how much the competition had grown.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"I follow Farnam online and saw the contest; I thought Maxwell would love this. I had a good picture of him and just thought I'd enter. I didn't realize how competitive it was," says Stephenie,</span><span style="color: #222222;"> an </span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">Arizona</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">&nbsp;native and small business owner from the Scottsdale area.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #222222;">&ldquo;We were very pleased with the participation in the 2019 SuperMask</span><span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: #222222;"> SuperModel Contest. We more than doubled the number of entries from last year. The word is spreading," notes Anna Brunetti, Digital Marketing Manager for Farnam. "Over 2,000 horse owners submitted photos from all over the country. The entries included many different breeds, colors, sizes, and ages, each image as unique as the next. It&rsquo;s great seeing all these horses so loved by their owners.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #222222;">Every entry was carefully studied by contest officials and after much deliberation, the top ten entries were identified, and those ten images were then submitted to a diverse panel of judges to determine the winner.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #222222;">"The SuperMask</span><span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: #222222;"> SuperModel contest is a great way for Farnam fans to showcase the outstanding care they give their horses all year long. As we all know, it is continuous, quality care that keeps horses happy and healthy for the long haul, and it showed in the caliber of entries we received. Many of the contenders put in valuable time and lots of elbow grease to 'spit shine' their horses for this contest," notes </span><span class="gd" style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt; color: #202124;">Martha Lefebvre,</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Senior Marketing Manager for Farnam</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: black;">After Stephenie received notification that her horse was chosen as the winner, she was amazed at the abundance of prizes he'd won, an impressive fly control and grooming package worth $1,000 in Farnam products. </span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"I didn't realize I was going to get so much," she says. '"I've been in horses since I was six years old and have always used Farnam products. When I opened the prize box, I realized I used most of them already. But there were some products I'd never tried before, so that was cool."</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">Of course, another big part of the win was that Maxwell would have a professional photo session so his image can be used in upcoming advertisements for Farnam's ever-popular </span><span style="color: black;">SuperMask fly mask.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"I told Maxwell, 'you're going to be a model,' and he is a horse who <em>wants</em> to have his photo taken.</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;"></span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">He has a look about him," says Stephenie. "I've always loved spending time pampering and grooming him, so this is proof it's worth it."</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"A well-cared for horse doesn't happen overnight. We appreciate that it takes </span><span style="color: black;">hard work, total commitment and a lot of love," says Martha, adding that plans are in the works for the 2020 contest.</span></p>
        <h2 style="background: #fefefe;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Horse-centered Life</span></strong></h2>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">Stephenie</span><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;has shared her life with horses ever since she was a young girl.</span><span style="color: #222222;"> </span><span style="color: #222222;">Growing up, she team roped and was very involved in rodeo. Although&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">reining and</span><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;reined cow horse competition always appealed to her, she just didn't have the right horse. At least, not until recently.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #222222;">Four years old at the time, Electric Java, was a rich&nbsp;sorrel Quarter Horse gelding with a striking blaze and a kind eye. He was talented, sound and personable. Although he'd only been shown once or twice at that time, the horse had a big stop and was impressive. It didn't take more than one ride for Stephenie to fall in love.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #222222;">Electric Java goes by the barn name of "Maxwell" and the duo has been making their mark in the show world.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"When you take him in the show pen, he wants you to be happy with him," says Stephenie.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #222222;">Stephenie rides as a non-pro, so their accomplishments have taken time and she gives all the credit to her "consistently amazing" horse. </span><span style="color: black;">Maxwell has a laid-back personality and nothing seems to faze this&nbsp;handsome gelding. His personality endears him to everyone who meets him. An accomplished competitor, he's definitely successful, but it's more than that.</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">"He's gentle with dogs, kids, and my minis; I have four miniature horses and he thinks he's one of them," laughs </span><span style="color: black;">Stephenie.&nbsp;"If he could have a job of being groomed and photographed, that would be his job. He loves the attention. He's a pet, but he's not annoying,&nbsp;or at least not to me!"</span><span style="color: #0a0a0a;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: #fefefe;"><span style="color: black;">"It took a long time to find one like him," she says happily. "I have owned enough horses to know he's a once-in-a-lifetime horse&nbsp;and a dream come true!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
