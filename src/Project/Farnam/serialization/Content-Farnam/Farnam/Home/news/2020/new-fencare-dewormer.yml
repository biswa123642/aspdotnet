        <p>Easy, safe and effective parasite control with Farnam&reg; FenCare&trade; dewormer</p>
        <p>Every horse has parasites to some degree, and sometimes they are no big deal. But when parasites become a concern, it is time to look for a targeted deworming product that is proven to control your horse&rsquo;s specific problem parasites. </p>
        <p>Farnam, your partner in horse care&trade;, is pleased to introduce Farnam&reg; FenCare&trade; Safe-Guard&reg; (fenbendazole) 1.96% Type B medicated feed in easy-to-feed, pre-measured packets. Each single-dose FenCare<sup>TM</sup> deworming packet contains a full effective dose of fenbendazole that treats horses up to 1,250 pounds and helps control common equine parasites. FenCare&trade; dewormer has an apple flavor horses love and should be mixed into your horse&rsquo;s regular ration for easy feeding. The pelleted formula is perfect for horses who get spooked at the sight of a syringe. </p>
        <p>The active ingredient in FenCare<sup>TM </sup>dewormer is fenbendazole, which is proven effective in controlling four key horse parasites: Small and Large Strongyles, Pinworms, and Ascarids. The presence and levels of these parasites can be identified by your veterinarian through a simple fecal sample, making it easy to know when and how to use FenCare&trade; dewormer as a targeted treatment. For horses with a wider range of parasites, Farnam offers a variety of broad spectrum deworming products. </p>
